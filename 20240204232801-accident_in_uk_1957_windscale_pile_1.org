#+title: Accident in UK 1957 Windscale Pile 1
At the beginning, the scientists has less knowlege to the degradation of the graphite under exposure of high flux neutrons.

1. graphite degradation
2. metallic uranium in the core overheated
3. fresh air cooling turned up
4. not noticing that some of the uranium and graphite were already alight
5. blast furnace
6. $CO_2$-cooling turned on but was unable to check the fire
7. water-cooling turned on --> problematic, because the high temperature would be possible to chang the water into oxygen and hydrogen, which could lead to an explosion
8. fortunatelly is was not exploded
9. but still plenty of radioactive materials were released into the air
