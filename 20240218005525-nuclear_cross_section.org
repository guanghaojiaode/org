#+title: Nuclear Cross Section
Nuclear cross section of a nucleus describes the probability that a nuclear reaction occurs. Unit: barn. The nuclear cross section of uranium-235 for slow thermal neutrons is about 1000 barns. For fast neutrons, it is in the order of 1 barn.

It is interesting that the thermal neutrons have higher nuclear cross section and interect more with the nucleus.
