#+title: Nuclear Reactor Generation I
It is very interesting that most of the first generation of nuclear reactors are incorporated with production of Platinum. This is used for the weapons. But when a peaceful world came, the production of Platinum are shut down. However, The producted Platinum can be used for modern reactors. Therefore, the nuclear reactors of generation 1 are already obsolete.
