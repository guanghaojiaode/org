#+title: Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR)
It generates actually a by-product $H_2$. This is a pebble-bed reactor.

A large amount of pebbles form the core.

In each pebble, there is graphite with fuel in it. The pebble is coated with ceramics.

The inert gas is used.

This kind of design is extremely flexible.

VHTR actually concludes also the [[id:37ac686a-0e93-41f2-a1c8-444589db8127][Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR)]], and other reactors using
