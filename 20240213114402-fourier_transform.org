#+title: Fourier Transform
* Begin from a question
At first, consider that there is a signal of time and intensity. For example the sound wave. The intensity now will be the pressure at our eardrum.

Actually it is composed of different simple waves and can be described by different simple waves. But the problem is, how to find these simple waves out?
* Wrap it into a "circle" and rotate it
The solution is, at first wrap this signal into a circle.
The next step is rotate it at different frequency.
E.g. at a small frequency, it looks like this:

But we keep increasing the frequency until it has the same frequency with the original signal, the pattern will looks like this:

[[file:images/pattern_2_fourier_transform.png]]

So, they looks different, but how to express their difference?
The answer is the centroid mass of the "circle".
* Centroid of mass vs. frequency
Now, if we plot centroid of mass vs. frequency, it looks like this:

[[file:images/fourier_transform_centroid.png]]

From the plot we can see several different peaks. This means actually that the wave is added up by different simple waves.

In this way we can find out how many simple waves are added up to form this original complex wave. And we can filter out the signals at different frequency as we wish.

But what is the problem?! -- we need to find suitable tools to process all of these steps.
* Mathematics
The [[id:b671a884-2100-47d6-ae20-bd0397016075][Euler's Formula]] transform the trigonometric functions into the complex plane, which is a perfect tool to code the amplitude and the phase in the "rotation".

The rotation is well expressed by $e^{2\pi it}$. But if we want to apply the rotation at different frequency, we need to add the frequency $f$ to the formula, which transforms into $e^{2\pi ift}$. And a minus is added to describe the clockwise rotation according to our habit: $e^{-2\pi ift}$.

Now, we need to apply this rotation upon the original signal $g(t)$. So it transforms into $g(t)e^{-2\pi ift}$.

But how to describe the centroid of mass? The answer is: Integration:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\int _{t_1}^{t_2} g(t) e^{-2\pi ift} dt
\end{equation}
But actually the Fourier transform does not need the time term $\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}$. After deleting it, we can tell that how long does one simple signal last. If one signal has a huge value of "mass centroid" (although it is no longer a centroid of mass), it means this simple signal lasts very long.

So that, Fourier transform:
\begin{equation}
\^{g}(t) = \int _{t_1}^{t_2} g(t) e^{-2\pi ift} dt
\end{equation}
