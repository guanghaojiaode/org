#+title: Motivation Presentation
* Thermal Scenario
- The thermal scenario is important.
- The heat transfer of Na and $H_2O$ is different.
- The convection and the conduction -- which is dominant in the heat transfer of liquid sodium? (*)
- This question above (*) should be included in the explanation of the PPT.
- What is the relationship between the reactor scale and the [[id:c936dd65-e215-4839-84e9-50b51b1e296a][Void Coefficien]]?

* Unorganized
- Safety issues may appear more often in 30 small reactors than in 1 huge reactor. 
- I just need to mention that this is "an unlikely scenario". That's enough.
