There are also [[id:25404e63-141a-44f6-ada4-b483f774e2ab][Molten Salt Reactor (MSR)]] and [[id:37ac686a-0e93-41f2-a1c8-444589db8127][Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor (SCWR).]]Why Generation IV?1. Inherently safe2. Retention of the fuel in the core --> Prevent from nuclear weapons proliferation3. Higher operating temperature (typically 850-1000 Â°C) --> higher thermal efficiency (efficiency of the thermal cycle: 45-50%)4. [[id:a5f52420-2cdf-4eee-9cf9-056e34c12c2e][Thorium]]-Uranium cycle --> Thorium has more reserve than Uranium.   (Cite: Nuclear Power: A very short introduction)   5. Public perception concerns6. minimize and manage the nuclear waste   (Cite: Nuclear Energy, Nicholas Tsoulfanidis, Page 177)
