CIBD: contactless inductive bubble detection

* Objectives:
1. Present a new model of the ECFM response, when the fluid go through it. It is more general than the model developed by other people before.
2. To show that the ECFM response can well estimate the size and position of the bubbles in a column of liquid [[id:c725b5ff-1d72-486d-8d14-26b419b70dd2][Galinstan (GaInSn)]].

* Mechanism
The mechanism of the ECFM is the Lorenz force.

Two coils measure the perturbation of the magnetic field created by the primary coil.
