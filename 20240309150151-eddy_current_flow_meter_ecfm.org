#+title: Eddy Current Flow Meter (ECFM)
ECFM was originally designed to measure the flow rate of liquid metal flows in pipes.

The primary coil generates at first an alternating magnetic field. When the liquid metal flows in the pipe, the fluid motion induces small eddy currents that perturb the magnetic field.

The second coil measures this perturbation and the perturbations are a function of the fluid velocity. ([[id:fb438f94-ba4a-4ad6-947c-328bfaf1b0c2][afflardBubbleDetectionLiquid2023]])
