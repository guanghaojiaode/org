* Scenario: Unprotected Loss of Flow (ULOF) in SFR (Almost impossible)
- Complete failure of redundant shutdown systems [cite:@suzukiPreliminaryEvaluationUnprotected2015]
- Failure forced circulation (e.g. Station Blackout) [cite:@zhaoNumericalSimulationNatural2023]
- Thermal mixing happens primarily due to natural convection [cite:@guenadou107PUBLICATIONS7802022]

The reduction of the coolant flow causes (1) the fuel temperature rise and (2) the fuel thermal expansion, and the thermal expansion changes the fuel-cladding gap width. This change affects (3) the gap conductance and the thermal condition changes accordingly. The events progress while the thermal behavior and the mechanical behavior interact with each other. The coolant gradually boils and it causes the cladding temperature rise. In an assembly where the strength of the cladding is sufficiently degraded due to the temperature rise, (4) the fuel pellets temperature rises, the molten cavities develop, and (5) the fuel is disrupted when the fuel pellets cannot maintain their shape due to the strength degradation. Hence, the fuel disruption largely depends on the fuel pin thermal behavior and the fuel pin mechanical behavior. Furthermore, when the power excursion occurs due to the positive reactivity insertion which is caused by the coolant boiling, (6) the pressure applied by the fuel to the cladding, which is called the contact pressure, causes (7) the fuel pin failure in an assembly where the cladding keeps the strength due to sufficient cooling.

Experiments show that the viscosity has a greater impact on the bubble coalescence. The greater the viscosity, the harder the bubbles are to coalesce. [cite:@daiTheoryTechnologyMultiscale2022]
