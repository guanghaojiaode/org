#+title: Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing
* Why should we reprocess the waste?
- Actually we just use only a little bit energy of the total energy in the fuel.
- The storage of the [[id:16df8af2-39a6-4b07-934b-0598b0ec0a9f][Radioactive Waste]] is hard.
- So that we need to utilize the fuel as much as possible.
* Method
- One typical method is PUREX Process (Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by extraction).
- Other methods:
  - UREX
  - TRUEX
  - SANEX
