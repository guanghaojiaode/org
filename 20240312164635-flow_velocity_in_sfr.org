#+title: Flow Velocity in SFR

* Question: Will it be a problem to have no velocity in the experiment?
- Are the experiment results still meaningful? Because there is velocity in the reactor, but there is maybe no velocity in our experiments.
* DOING Question: Is there flow velocity during the hypothetical scenarios?
- I mean, yes during the normal operation, the velocity is high. But the hypothetical scenarios are different.
- Yes, there is [[id:6d0b371f-4cdf-4d53-8368-8b1a690bdc59][Natural Circulation in the SFR]]. Some research has already been done on this topic.
#+begin_quote
Together with a high capacity of natural circulation flow establishment in SFR, the boiling of the total sodium mass under residual power deposition (after loss of forced circulation) takes several hours. (a comparative study on severe accident...)
The time delay to coolant boiling is strongly related to the fact that under nominal conditions, the margin to coolant boiling in SFR is higher compared to the operating PWR as is indicated in Table 1. Moreover, in SFR ‘pool-type’ reactors, the loss of coolant due to loss of pressurization e.g. pipe rupture is practically eliminated. Consequently, the severe accident scenarios with fast total loss of cooling are practically eliminated. ([[id:9397442b-3401-4bee-9e8d-b95d9f224022][bachrataComparativeStudySevere2021]])

* Question: Which scenario is our focus? Which process does it have?
- The [[id:8fc68ce9-87c2-45c7-9542-87c6c6139fbc][Core Disruptive Accident (CDA)]] accident is our focus. 
* Question: Does liquid sodium go through the structure of the core?
CLOSED: [2024-03-14 Thu 21:07]
- Yes. Of Course.
* What will change if there is a flow velocity?
** What does "meaningful" mean?
- How much does the flow velocity influence the bubble behavior?
  + *Then we can ask, what is the typical flow velocity in a nuclear reactor?*
    [[file:images/flow_velocity.png][Flow Velocities in Fast Reactors]]
    It is in the range of 2-9 m/s. The average is about 6 m/s. (Fast Reactor Database 2006 Update)
  + *Which [[id:da14bc48-3d11-4e21-8909-5044e48dcb5f][Bubble Behaviors]] exist in the nuclear reactor?*
    Typically there are growth, sliding, detachment, coalescence, bursting, and condensation. ([[id:973b3f7e-b2b3-4c9a-91ea-91b36d00150e][qinVibrationMethodCharacterization2022]])
** Heat transfer is important for liquid sodium.
- There are three different types of [[id:bc3476ae-96b8-4c57-9b4f-2bfaa12bf1f1][Heat Transfer]]. Conduction, convection and radiation.
- The heat transfer in liquid sodium caused by the change of the flow velocity is mainly due to the change of the convection. 
  #+begin_quote
- The thermal conductivity of liquid sodium is two orders of magnitude higher than that of ordinary fluids (such as water, Freon) and this results in the convective heat transfer of liquid sodium being different from that of ordinary fluids.

** The bubble size.
#+begin_quote
At these high flow rates, the bubble size distribution seems to be largely dominated by bubble coalescence and breakup. At very high flow rates, single nozzles go into jetting mode and the bubble size distribution results from breakup of the jet and sometimes subsequent coalescence.

** Are there any dimensionless numbers that are important for these questions?
- [[id:a703a0c8-0260-42d2-b58a-4625b5eaa7f2][Prandtl Number (Pr)]] is an important number representing whether the thermal diffusion or the momentum diffusion dominates.
- [[id:a085096a-8909-42d6-88d6-1c2d51e8c6b2][Nusselt Number (Nu)]] is also an important number for the heat transfer.
- [[id:355d14d9-fc5f-4b2b-8de0-43936b1bd04e][Weber Number (We)]] is a number for the surface tension.
** How does flow velocity change the bubble behavior?
** What is the situation for water instead of sodium?
- [[id:3d473d21-5ba7-40f2-a5b8-84cc6c46a920][Bubble Coalescence]]
** What is the difference between water and sodium?
- The most significant difference is the [[id:6d7a63dd-dfbf-48f8-b836-f50728e0112c][Surface Tension]].
- Until 2021, the difference between water and liquid sodium has not been quantified, because it could not yet. ([[id:458876ec-83c2-4b8d-a4a7-e6b487f21046][haasReviewBubbleDynamics2021]]) How about today?
