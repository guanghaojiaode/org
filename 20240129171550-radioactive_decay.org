#+title: Radioactive Decay
The radioactive decay of an [[id:b005aca0-4e81-4c8f-883e-462d7bec4710][Isotope]] is unpredictable and is random. But for many isotopes an average half-life of it can be measured.

The neutron-induced decay of [[id:a9bd8f0a-53f9-4597-8f8d-1ab69150f37c][Uranium]] is different: It does not simply emit energy and small particles like some other nucleis, but it will be splitted into different big parts.
