   This accident was prevented by some Fail-Safe technologies. For example, the containment building was essential for preventing the accident from changing into a hazard.

   The main reason for this accident is mainly due to the false operation of the workers. If they could commission the plant before the new year, they would get the tax-free for 1 year. So the plant was rushed into operation. The staff are not properly trained.
