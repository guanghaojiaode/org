#+title: Evolutionary Power Reactor (EPR)
EPR is actually a development of a [[id:b31e2ab4-a8dd-43b1-aa56-e0fd20a10353][Pressured Water Reactors (PWRs)]] to use highly enriched uranium oxide or the mixture of uranium and thorium (MOX).

Compare to the PWRs:

It is more compact than the normal Generation III reactors, thus it can be build in a shorter time. It has also many safety features and produced much less wastes.

It has 4 separeted and independent emergency system.

It is also interesting that it is resistant to the aeroplane crash and earthquake.
