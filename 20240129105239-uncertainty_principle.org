#+title: Uncertainty Principle
The position and the momentum of a particle can never be determined precisely at the same time.

Heisenberg has said: If you want to measure one precisely, the other one will be definitely disturbed. When we observe a system, it is determined to be alterd!

However, this is not convinced:

- He did not point out how to measure the momentum of a particle.
- The experiment has not been done to convince it.
