#+title: Quantum Mechanics
Actually this is a subject that describes particles in a wave way.

The quantum mechanics is importatant in describing the nuclear. One important feature of the quantum mechanics is "discrete". The energy is regarded as discrete.

As we think that a particle appears in a box with a homogeneous possobility, in quantum mechanics a particle appears in the box with a inhomogenous possobility. 

e.g.: The electrons around a nucleus can be regarded as the waves.
