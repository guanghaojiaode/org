However, for liquid metal-cooled fast reactors, CDA is even more important. If the core is melted, the molten fuel compaction increases the reactivity of the core, leading to recriticality, a sudden increase in power, and a rapid release of significant energy, resulting in a CDA (Tentner et al., 2010; Wang, 2017). In general, in the study of liquid metal-cooled reactors, severe accidents are equated with CDA.
