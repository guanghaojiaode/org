#+title: Theory of Relativity
This is very interesting that Einstein derived the time dilation (The time seems to be different because of the movement.) from very simple examples and equations.

It is very important for the understanding, also astonishing that:

For a moving person and a stationary person, the effect of the relativity is the same. That means, they both think that the time of the other one is slowed down.

Actually the relative movement leads to the change in relative observation of time, length and mass.

It is also very interesting that Einstein convinced that the acceleration is also relative. There is no absolute acceleration.
