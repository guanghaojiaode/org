#+title: Surface Tension
* Definition
- Liquid shrinks into the minimum surface area possible.
- The symbol $\gamma$ is used to describe it.
* Example
- Water surface tension is already pretty high. The surface tension of Mercury is higher.
| Material      | Temperature (Celcius) | Temp Coefficient     | Surface Tension    | Citation                     |
|---------------+-----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------|
| liquid sodium |                  97.8 | -0.11 dyn cm-1 deg-1 | 200.2Â±0.6 dyn cm-1 | [[id:fcc4c8f7-61ea-419e-81d1-6dcd3b7b4d09][jordanSurfaceTensionLiquid1965]] |
| water         |                   100 |                      | 58.85 dyn cm-1     | [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension][Surface Tension]]                |

- Therefore, the surface tension of sodium is much higher than water.
* Questions
** What does it mean to have a high surface tension regarding the bubble behavior?
** What [[id:dfd1d9a2-98fe-4be2-ab7e-d2e0f750f32b][Hypothesis]] can we make?
