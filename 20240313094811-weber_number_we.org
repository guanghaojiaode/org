#+title: Weber Number (We)
$We = \frac{Drag\ Force}{Cohesion\ Force} = \frac{\rho v^2 l}{\sigma}$
- It represents the ratio between the effects of the inertial force and the surface tension.
- This is a number that represents the [[id:6d7a63dd-dfbf-48f8-b836-f50728e0112c][Surface Tension]].
- The smaller We are, the more important the surface tension. For a huge-scale problem, $We>>1$, the effect of the surface tension is negligible.
- In this article [[id:6056d62d-d53b-4d3f-b9d2-a2aeacf5b3e7][wangSurfaceTensionEffects2011]], the relationship between We and bubble behaviors is analyzed.
- This We number is highly related to the behavior of [[id:3d473d21-5ba7-40f2-a5b8-84cc6c46a920][Bubble Coalescence]].
