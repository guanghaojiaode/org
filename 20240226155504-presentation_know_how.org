#+title: Presentation Know-How
- General information
	- Equations --> make them clear
	- Do not derive equations in a presentation
	- Do not pay much attention to the math, but only show the key things
	- Duration: 15 min, 900 s
	- 9-10 slides + 1 title page + 1 toc page
- Structures
	- Title slide **10s**
	- Table of content **10s**
		- Do not read it.
		- Be a little specific.
		- Just say: This is the content. I am going to show you these things. 
	- Motivation **1min** --> This is not Introduction!
		1. Background --> Be specific
		2. Problems/Open questions (Subject) --> Be specific
		- Often Problems: Too general
			- e.g.: Global warming --> climate change --> my problems
			- This above is too general! Be specific.
	- Introduction **5~6min** (What is a good introduction?)
		1. State of science & technology 
		2. Derive my own objects --> to refer to my specific topic
			- e.g.: In the research this is not well-researched, so I am working on ..., and will write ..., I need parameters A, B and ...
			- Parameters, methodology
			- Please don't say other people's work bad.
	- Materials & Methods **3~4min**
		- (My experimental and/or numerical environment)
		- Materials: Machine and Hardware
		- Methods: Software
			- Methodological Structure
			- Algorithms
			- Just point out I use this and that, don't go into too much details. 
	- Results & Discussion **5min**
		- Recommendation: At first present the overview for 1 slide and do not discuss it.
		- Go to 1 or 2 major interesting findings and make it specific.
		- Do not go in too much details. Make it more interesting.
		- But do not forget our object.
	- Conclusions **less than 1min**
		- What are the key findings of my results?
		- There also can be improof.
		- Who could use our results?
		- Have I gone into the right/wrong way?
		- Guide the conclusions according to the hypothesis
			- Actually the hypothesis is more for the natural science.
			- Can we answer Yes or No?
			- For example
				- Hypothesis: The light velocity in the vacuum does not change.
				- Explanations:
					- 1. ...
					- 2. ...
				- To prove and answer --> Begin of the work
					- exp 1.
					- exp 2.
					- ...
				-  Proof/improof
