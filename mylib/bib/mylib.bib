  abstract = {A model has been developed to predict the response of an eddy current flow meter (ECFM) to the passage of a non-conductive inclusion moving in a cylindrical tube filled with a liquid metal. The model can be solved analytically for small inclusion diameters and moderate AC frequencies of the excitation signal. This condition is expressed as vbS{$\omega$} ( 1, where vb is the dimensionless inclusion volume and S{$\omega$} is a function of the ratio between the characteristic length of the system and the penetration depth of the magnetic field. The magnetic induction equation for this problem has also been solved numerically. A very good agreement between the analytical model and numerical solutions has been found for vbS{$\omega$} ( 1. Two experimental setups have been designed. First, the ECFM model has been validated by comparing the response due to the passage of traveling beads of known diameters in a low melting point alloy. In a second experiment, the diameters of ascending argon bubbles have been estimated with the ECFM model. The numerical model predicts the gas volume with very good accuracy in the range of bubble diameters studied, between 1.5 and 6 mm, while the analytical model only deviates significantly from the experimental data when vbS{$\omega$} * 0:1. Moreover, we establish that the ECFM can also measure the radial deviation of the bubble trajectory, and the results are consistent with the theoretical limit for isolated bubbles between the regimes of oscillating/zigzag motion of ellipsoidal bubbles and non-oscillating motion of spherical bubbles. Another observation is that the dependence of the ECFM response on the shape of the bubble is negligible; indeed, the ECFM response is well approximated by a linear relation with the bubble volume as is assumed in the analytical model. Finally, an estimation of the terminal rising velocity of bubbles was also carried out.},

  abstract = {The use of X-ray flow visualization has brought a powerful new tool to the study of multiphase flows. Penetrating radiation can probe the spatial concentration of the different phases without the refraction, diffraction, or multiple scattering that usually produce image artifacts or reduce the signal-to-noise ratio below reliable values in optical visualization of multiphase flows; hence, X-ray visualization enables research into the three-dimensional (3D) structure of multiphase flows characterized by complex interfaces. With the commoditization of X-ray laboratory sources and wider access to synchrotron beam time for fluid mechanics, this novel imaging technique has shed light onto many multiphase flows of industrial and environmental interest under realistic 3D configurations and at realistic operating conditions (high Reynolds numbers and high volume fractions) that had defied study for decades. We present a broad survey of the most commonly studied multiphase flows (e.g., sprays, fluidized beds, bubble columns) in order to highlight the progress X-ray imaging has made in understanding the internal structure and multiphase coupling of these flows, and we discuss the potential of advanced tomography and time-resolved and particle tracking radiography for further study of multiphase flows.},

In particular, the ability to measure X-ray and neutron diffraction of water with unprecedented high accuracy in an extended range of momentum transfers has allowed the derivation of detailed O--O pair correlation functions. A panorama of the diffusive dynamics of water in a wide range of temperatures (from 400 K down to supercooled water) and pressures (from ambient up to multiple gigapascals) is presented. The recent results obtained by quasi-elastic neutron scattering under high pressure are compared with the existing data from nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric and infrared measurements, and modeling. A detailed description of the vibrational dynamics of water as measured by inelastic neutron scattering is presented. The dependence of the water vibrational density of states on temperature and pressure, and in the presence of biological molecules, is discussed. Results about the collective dynamics of water and its dispersion curves as measured by coherent inelastic neutron scattering and inelastic X-ray scattering in different thermodynamic conditions are reported.},

Localization and tracking of microbubbles (MBs), two significant steps of ULM, facilitate generating the vascular map and the velocity distribution, respectively. Herein, we propose a novel MB tracking technique considering temporal pairing as a bubble-set registration problem. Iterative registration is performed between the bubble sets in two consecutive time instants by analytically optimizing a cost function that takes position and point-spread function (PSF) similarities as well as physically plausible levels of bubbles' movement into account. Furthermore, we infer MBs' parity in a fuzzy manner instead of binary. The proposed technique performs well in validation experiments with two synthetic and two in vivo datasets provided by the Ultrasound Lo-calisation and TRacking Algorithms for Super Resolution (ULTRA-SR) Challenge.},

Renewable sources of hydrogen such as hydrogen from water electrolysis need to be driven to similar production costs as methane reforming to address global greenhouse gas emission concerns.

  abstract = {During offshore production, it is typical to discharge produced water into the sea after treating it to a level that meets environmental regulations. A growth in the volumes of produced water and increasingly stringent re\- quirements have drawn attention to re-injection of produced water as a more viable disposal method. Produced water re-injection is regarded as an environmentally friendly and cost-efficient approach that allows integration of produced water with reservoir management. However, loss of injectivity, due to the plugging of pores by oil droplets and particles present in produced water, limits implementation of re-injection. This review discusses engineering challenges during re-injection and summarizes the knowledge and the gaps in the literature on the permeability reduction due to the flow of dilute oil-in-water emulsions. First, a short introduction into the origins of produced water, its composition, and the treatment techniques employed offshore are provided. An overview of the water injection strategies as well as a discussion of the past field experience of produced water re-injection is given. This is followed by a detailed review of the flow of diluted oil-in-water emulsions through porous media from the permeability reduction perspective. An overview of models for predicting permeability reduction during the flow of emulsions is provided. The physical parameters affecting the droplet retention and physicochemical interactions between droplets and pore walls are discussed. The studies that investigated co-injection of oil droplets and solid particles are included as well. The review identified that the effect of droplet stability, oil viscosity, wettability, and particles on droplet retention is not sufficiently examined. It was found that drop-topore size ratio is a crucial factor for droplet retention, but it is often omitted in the industry. An outlook on the gaps and suggestions to address them was provided. Microfluidics was pointed out as a complementary technique to coreflooding.},

Firstly, the two considered reactor concepts are introduced by focusing on safety aspects. The severe accident scenarios leading to core melting are presented and the initiating events are highlighted. The paper focuses on in-vessel severe accident phenomena, including the chronology of core damage, major changes in the core configuration and molten core progression. Regarding the mitigation means, the in-vessel retention phenomena and the core catcher characteristics are reviewed for these different nuclear generation concepts (II, III and IV). A comparison between the PWR and SFR severe accident evolution is provided as well as the relation between governing physical parameters and the adopted mitigation provisions for each reactor concept. Finally, it is highlighted how the robustness of the safety demonstration is established by means of a combined probabilistic and deterministic approach.},

  abstract = {The ultrafast electron beam X-ray tomography scanner ROFEX is used for the investigation of multiphase flows. Its functional principle allows us to obtain sequences of cross-sectional flow images, which shows local attenuation properties of the flow. Hence, the X-ray CT images mainly reveal the shape and interfaces of flow constituents, such as gas, liquid and solids via their X-ray contrast. It is, however, more difficult to obtain velocity information from multiphase flows. In this article we discuss different methods to extract information on the velocities of particles or interfaces as well as for continuous phase. For disperse phase velocity measurement, e.g. in gas--liquid or gas--solids flows, we employ cross-correlation based techniques using two imaging planes. Apart from the standard cross-correlation technique we developed a method and algorithm, which is capable to identify identical bubbles in the two planes giving us a unique Lagrangian particle-related velocity information. Eventually we give an example of velocity measurement in the continuous liquid phase using an X-ray contrast agent.},

  abstract = {The intensity of a monochromatic X-ray beam decreases exponentially with the distance it has traveled inside a material; this behavior is commonly referred to as Beer-Lambert's law. Knowledge of the material-specific attenuation coefficient {\textmu} allows us to determine the thickness of a sample from the intensity decrease the beam has experienced. However, classical X-ray tubes emit a polychromatic bremsstrahlung-spectrum. And the attenuation coefficients of all materials depend on the photon energy: photons with high energy are attenuated less than photons with low energy. In consequence, the X-ray spectrum changes while traveling through the medium; due to the relative increase in high energy photons, this effect is called beam hardening. For this varying spectrum, the Beer-Lambert law only remains valid if {\textmu} is replaced by an effective attenuation coefficient {\textmu}eff which depends not only on the material but also on its thickness x and the details of the X-ray setup used. We present here a way to deduce {\textmu}eff(x) from a small number of auxiliary measurements using a phenomenological model. This model can then be used to determine an unknown material thickness or in the case of a granular media its volume fraction.},

The largest pores were {$\sim$}250{$\mu$}m in the carbon cloth and {$\sim$}40{$\mu$}m in the Toray carbon paper. The largest pores in a catalyst layer applied to the woven carbon cloth were {$\sim$}20{$\mu$}m. Increasing the applied hydrostatic pressure permitted water to flow through smaller pores in the GDL.

It includes a new method for determining the three-dimensional shape and velocity vector of each individual bubble. In the experimental part, argon gas was injected through a single nozzle located slightly above the bottom of a cylindrical vessel filled with liquid sodium. The gas flow rate was varied between 10 and 635 cm3/min to obtain a chain of individual bubbles. In this parameter range, collisions of bubbles, coalescence or breakup are not expected. Measurements were carried out in a wide spatial range starting near the nozzle up to a height of about 200 mm above it. It was convincingly demonstrated that two-plane UFXCT imaging, in combination with the data processing presented here, allows a reliable charac\- terization of the size, shape and velocity of bubbles with a size of a few millimeters in a sodium column of 54 mm diameter. Moreover, a reproducible fluctuation of shape, position and velocity has been observed in the ex\- periments in the lower part of the column.},

  abstract = {While most research on particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is devoted either to 2D flows or to small-scale 3D flows, this paper describes a complete 3D PTV algorithm and some applications to indoor airflow velocity measurements. A particle detection procedure especially adapted to the physical characteristics of neutrally buoyant helium-filled soap bubbles is described. To recover longer trajectories, a temporal tracking algorithm is used based on polynomial regression and including a cross-gap and a forward--backward strategy. In order to increase the measurement area and the number of trajectories, the correspondence problem is addressed by a new procedure involving fundamental matrices from both a three and a two-camera arrangement. 3D reconstruction is done by a least-squares method. Some guidelines are given in terms of camera and light positioning for 3D PTV in large volumes. Applications of the algorithm include Lagrangian tracking in (i) a 3.1 m {\texttimes} 3.1 m {\texttimes} 2.5 m light-gray walled test-room; (ii) a 5.5 m {\texttimes} 3.7 m {\texttimes} 2.4 m black walled test-room; (iii) over a heat source; (iv) inside an experimental aircraft cabin.

  abstract = {A two-dimensional, transient, finite difference technique based on a volume fraction specification of the free surface position and accounting for the effects of surface tension is shown to accurately predict the initial motion of large cylindrical and spherical bubbles. The predictions compare very favourably with the experimental data of Walters and Davidson. The initial acceleration of cylindrical and spherical bubbles is properly predicted as g and 2g respectively. The penetration of a tongue of liquid from below is the dominant process by which large deformations from the original shape take place and is well predicted by the model in both cases. For the spherical case the eventual transition into a toroidal bubble is demonstrated and the circulation associated with a rising toroidal bubble as a function of its volume upon release is shown to agree very well with experiments. Iterative linear equation-solving techniques applicable to the special nature of the linear system resulting from such a free surface specification are surveyed and a simple Jacobi iteration based on red-black ordering is found to perform well. The impact of the free surface on the relaxation of the linear system and the convergence criteria is also explored.},

  abstract = {Sodium boiling detection utilizing the sound pressure e{\textasciitilde}nanated during the collapse of a sodium vapor bubble in a subcooled media is discussed in terms of the sound characteristic{\textasciitilde} the reactor ambient noise background, transmission loss considerations and performance criteria. Data obtained in several loss of flow experiments on Fast Test Reactor Fuel Elements indicate that the collapse of the sodium vapor bubble depends on the presence of a subcooled structure or sodium. The collapse pressure pulse was observed in all cases to be on the order of a kPa, indicating a soft type of cavitational collapse. Spectral examination of the pulses indicates the response function of the test structure and geometry is important, The sodium boiling observed in these experiments was observed to occur at a low ({$<$}50{$^\circ$}C) liquid superheat with the rate of occurrence of sodium vapor bubble collapse in the 3 to 30 Hz range, Reactor ambient noise data were found to be due to machinery induced vibrations, flow induced vibrations, and flow noise. These data were further found to be weakly stationary enhancing the possibility of acoustic surveillance of an operating Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor. Based on these noise characteristics and extrapolating the noise measurements from the Fast Flux Test Facility Pump (FFTP), one would expect a signal to noise ratio of up to 20 dB in the {$\bullet$} absence of transmission loss. The requirement of a low false alarm probability is shown to necessitate post detection analysis of the collapse event sequence and the cross correlation with the second derivative of the neutronic boiling detection signal. Sodium boiling detection using the sounds emitted during sodium vapor bubble collapse are shown to be feasible but a need for in-reactor demonstration is necessary.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.},

The effects of liquid viscosity and surface tension on bubble coalescence, for which Reynolds number ranges from 10 to 100 and Bond number ranges from 5 to 50, are investigated. It is shown that the numerical model used in this study can accurately capture the complex topological changes during the coalescence. The predicted behaviour of bubble coalescence is in reasonable agreement with our experimental observation. It is found that with a high Reynolds number (low viscosity) a strong liquid jet formed behind the leading bubble inhibits the approach of the following bubble. Hence coalescence does not occur or is postponed. A lower surface tension results in an earlier coalescence because of severe stretching of the interface.},

Based on specially selected features, contours of bubbles in subsequent images can be automatically tracked. This novel method reveals to be rather robust and produces good results also under difficult illumination conditions or with reflections on the surface of bubbles. Furthermore, based on a criterion which evaluates the situation of overlapped bubbles, the system can also deal with the overlapping problem and identify the bubbles correctly. After tracking, some parameters such as the bubble departure diameter, bubble flow speed, and bubble volume can be estimated which are important to investigate the heat transfer in a boiling system.},

  abstract = {In the framework of PSI's FAST code system, the thermal--hydraulic code TRACE is being extended for representation of sodium two-phase flow. As the currently available version (v.5) is limited to the simulation of only single-phase sodium flow, its applicability range is not enough to study the behavior of a Generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) during transients in which boiling is anticipated. The work reported here concerns the extension of the non-homogeneous, non-equilibrium two-fluid models, which are available in TRACE for steam-water, to sodium two-phase flow simulation. The conventional correlations for ordinary gas--liquid flows are used as basis, with optional correlations specific to liquid metal where necessary. A number of new models for representation of the constitutive equations specific to sodium, with a particular emphasis on the interfacial transfer mechanisms, have been implemented and compared with the original closure models. A first assessment of the extended TRACE version has been carried out, by using the code to model experiments that simulate a loss-of-flow (LOF) accident in a SFR. One- and two-dimensional representations of the test section have been considered. Comparison of the 1D model predictions, with both experiment and SIMMER-III code predictions, confirm the ability of the extended TRACE code to predict the principal sodium boiling phenomena. Two-dimensional representation of the test section, however, has been found necessary for providing more detailed comparisons with the experimental data and thereby studying, in greater detail, the influence of the physical models on the calculated results. The paper thus presents a first-of-its-kind application of TRACE to two-phase sodium flow. It shows the capability of the extended code to predict sodium boiling onset, flow regimes, pressure evolution, dryout, etc. Although the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, the physical models should be further improved. Other integral experiments are planned to be simulated, in order to further develop and validate the two-phase sodium flow modeling.},

The advisors in turn, have established a Technical Working Group (TWG), chaired by Professor Carlo Rubbia, and now extended to the most part of the European Union member countries, in order to identify the critical technical issues for which R\&D is needed. The recommendations of the TWG, included in the recently issued document `A European roadmap for developing ADS for nuclear waste incineration' [April 2001] clearly indicate the need to design and operate, approximately in 12--15 years, an XADS at a sufficiently large scale to assess the feasibility of an industrial ADS for transmutation of nuclear waste. The European Community, through the 5th Framework Program, has launched a large program on partitioning and transmutation. This program which includes R\&D and preliminary design will constitute a reference for the choice of the technical solutions to be pursued forward during the 6th Framework Program. In Italy, since early 1998, the ENEA (National Research Organization for Innovative Energy), INFN (National Institute for Nuclear Physics), CRS4 (Research Institute) and Ansaldo have set up a team, led by Ansaldo, to design an 80 MWth XADS. The results obtained so far allow a consistent XADS configuration to be outlined.

  abstract = {The rise velocity of injected air phase from the injection point toward the vadose zone is a critical factor in in-situ air sparging operations. It has been reported in the literature that air injected into saturated gravel rises as discrete air bubbles in bubbly flow of air phase. The objective of this study is to develop a quantitative technique to estimate the rise velocity of an air bubble in coarse porous media. The model is based on the macroscopic balance equation for forces acting on a bubble rising in a porous medium. The governing equation incorporates inertial force, added mass force, buoyant force, surface tension and drag force that results from the momentum transfer between the phases. The momentum transfer terms take into account the viscous as well as the kinetic energy losses at high velocities. Analytical solutions are obtained for steady, quasi-steady, and accelerated bubble rise velocities. Results show that air bubbles moving up through a porous medium equilibrate after a short travel time and very short distances of rise. It is determined that the terminal rise velocity of a single air bubble in an otherwise water saturated porous medium cannot exceed 18.5 cm/s. The theoretical model results compared favorably with the experimental data reported in the literature. A dimensional analysis conducted to study the effect of individual forces indicates that the buoyant force is largely balanced by the drag force for bubbles with an equivalent radius of 0.2--0.5 cm. With increasing bubble radius, the dimensionless number representing the effect of the surface tension force decreases rapidly. Since the total inertial force is quite small, the accelerated bubble rise velocity can be approximated by the terminal velocity.},

We consider liquid foams in equilibrium for which the relevant energy is surface energy. Measurements of osmotic pressure can be used to determine this as a function of liquid fraction in good agreement with results from computer simulations. This approach is particularly useful in the description of foams with high liquid content, so-called wet foams. For such foams X-ray tomography proves to be an important technique in analysing order and disorder. Much of the discussion in this article is also relevant to bi-liquid foams, i.e. emulsions, and to solid foams, provided that the solidification preserves the structure of the initially liquid foam template.},

  abstract = {When two drops of radius               R               touch, surface tension drives an initially singular motion  which joins them into a bigger drop with smaller surface area. This motion is always  viscously dominated at early times. We focus on the early-time behaviour of the radius               r                                m                              of the small bridge between the two drops. The flow is driven by a highly curved  meniscus of length 2{$\pi$}               r                                m                              and width               {$\Delta$}               [Lt      ]               r                                m                              around the bridge, from which we conclude  that the leading-order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional  counterpart. For the case of inviscid surroundings, an exact two-dimensional solution  (Hopper 1990) shows that               {$\Delta$}               {$\propto$}               r               3                                m                              and               r                                m                              {$\sim$}(               t               {$\gamma$}/{$\pi\eta$}) ln  [               t               {$\gamma$}({$\eta$}               R               )]; and thus the same  is true in three dimensions. We also study the case of coalescence with an external  viscous fluid analytically and, for the case of equal viscosities, in detail numerically.  A significantly different structure is found in which the outer-fluid forms a toroidal  bubble of radius               {$\Delta$}               {$\propto$}               r               3/2                                m                              at the meniscus and               r                                m                              {$\sim$}(               t               {$\gamma$}/4{$\pi\eta$}) ln  [               t               {$\gamma$}/({$\eta$}               R               )].

It is shown that the foam and foam films are an efficient object in the study of various surface phenomena and in establishing regularities common for different interfaces, in particular, water/oil interface. The techniques and results on foam films have an independent meaning and involve the latest achievement in this field, with a focus on authors' results. The book has an expressed monographic character. It reveals joint ideas, i.e. the quantitative approach in treating foams is based on foam film behaviour and the techniques for controlling the foam liquid content, developed by the authors. A major contribution represents the independent consideration of formation and stability of foam films in theoretical and experimental aspects. No monograph published so far reveals these topics in the mentioned manner. Data and information about foams, physicochemical characterization of surfactants, phospholipids and polymers can also be found. Furthermore, the book provides information about: techniques involved in the study of foam films and foam structure and properties; foam drainage; processes of destruction in gravitational and centrifugal fields; reasons for stability of films and their role in the processes running in the foam; mechanical, rheological, optical, thermophysical, electrical properties; foam destruction upon addition of antifoams (mechanism of destruction, techniques, application); scientific principles of controlling foam properties and their application in foam separation and concentration; enhanced oil recovery; thermodynamic and non-equilibrium properties of foam films, stabilized by surfactants, phospholipids and polymers; techniques for the study of surface forces; formation and stability of foam films; black films, including bilayers; new theories of stability of amphiphile bilayer; experiments involved in this stability; application in biology and medicine.},

  abstract = {This work is an experimental study of the rise of an air bubble in still water.  For the bubble diameter considered, path oscillations develop in the absence of  shape oscillations and the effect of surfactants is shown to be negligible. Both the  three-dimensional motion of the bubble and the velocity induced in the liquid are  investigated. After the initial acceleration stage, the bubble shape remains constant  and similar to an oblate ellipsoid with its symmetry axis parallel to the bubble-centre  velocity, and with constant velocity magnitude. The bubble motion combines path  oscillations with slow trajectory displacements. (These displacements, which consist  of horizontal drift and rotation about a vertical axis, are shown to have no influence  on the oscillations). The bubble dynamics involve two unstable modes which have the  same frequency and are {$\pi$}/2 out of phase. The primary mode develops first, leading  to a plane zigzag trajectory. The secondary mode then grows, causing the trajectory  to progressively change into a circular helix. Liquid-velocity measurements are taken  up to 150 radii behind the bubble. The nature of the liquid flow field is analysed from  systematic comparisons with potential theory and direct numerical simulations. The  flow is potential in front of the bubble and a long wake develops behind. The wake  structure is controlled by two mechanisms: the development of a quasi-steady wake  that spreads around the non-rectilinear bubble trajectory; and the wake instability  that generates unsteady vortices at the bubble rear. The velocities induced by the  wake vortices are small compared to the bubble velocity and, except in the near wake,  the flow is controlled by the quasi-steady wake.},

These were designed to represent the flow with various liquid volume fractions throughout the Plateau border (PB) and node system within the "dry" limit and throughout the two nodes and PB system within the "wet" limit. Most surfaces in the models involve a gas-liquid interface. Here, the stress-balance boundary condition was applied to achieve coupling between the surface and bulk. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation along with the continuity equation was solved using the finite volume approach, and a qualitative evaluation of flow velocities in different foam geometries was obtained. The numerical results were validated against the available experimental results for foam permeabilities in the nodes and PBs. Discrepancies were expected between the simulated and empirical values as the latter values were obtained by considering only the viscous losses in the PBs. Furthermore, the scaled resistance to flow for varying gas-liquid interface mobilities and liquid fractions was studied. The individual geometrical characteristics of the node and PB components were compared to investigate the PB- and node-dominated flow regimes numerically. Additionally, more accurate information was obtained for comparing the average flow velocities within the node-PB and the two-node-PB systems, providing a better understanding of the effect of a gas-liquid interface on foam flow. We eventually show that when the foam geometry is correctly described, the relative effect of the geometrical factors of the PB and node components of system models can be evaluated, allowing a numerical flow simulation with a unique parameter-the Boussinesq number (Bo).}

For a time series without such bubbles, it can be shown that the variable when properly differenced has a stable mean. A simple test based on recursive residuals can now be used to timely discover whether a series experiences a bubble and also whether a collapse is near. Illustration on simulated data and on two housing prices and the Nikkei index illustrates the practical relevance of the new test.

At low capillary numbers break-up is not dominated by shear stresses: experimental results support the assertion that the dominant contribution to the dynamics of break-up arises from the pressure drop across the emerging droplet or bubble. This pressure drop results from the high resistance to flow of the continuous (carrier) fluid in the thin films that separate the droplet from the walls of the microchannel when the droplet fills almost the entire cross-section of the channel. A simple scaling relation, based on this assertion, predicts the size of droplets and bubbles produced in the T-junctions over a range of rates of flow of the two immiscible phases, the viscosity of the continuous phase, the interfacial tension, and the geometrical dimensions of the device.},

Regarding one-phase flow, intrinsic permeability and inertial coefficient (also named passability) are determined from a semi-analytical solution of the Darcy--Forchheimer--Brinkman equation, whereas concerning two-phase flow only gas phase relative properties are estimated through the generalized Darcy--Forchheimer equation. For the used experimental flow range, the results which are in line with former studies show the importance of the inertial effects. The in-situ foam compression and tightening effects lead to higher permeability and passability values, knowing that permeability coefficient is determined with a better accuracy than the inertial coefficient.},

Difference between the experimental conditions under which the foam films collapse and the bubble coalescence experiments has been pointed out. Possible reasons behind the failure of the film drainage models in predicting the coalescence time have been explained. Some directions for future research have also been discussed.},

  abstract = {Multiphase flow in porous media is relevant to amount of engineering processes, such as hydrocarbon extraction from reservoir rock, water contamination, CO2 geological storage and sequestration. Pore scale modeling, as an alternative approach to lab measurement, firstly serves as an effective bridge to link the pore scale properties (pore geometry and wettability) and displacement mechanisms to continuous scale multiphase flow in porous media; and secondly allows us to determine essential flow functions, such as capillary pressure and relative permeability curves, which are required for continuous scale modeling. In the literature, three methodologies, Bundle of Capillary Tube Modeling (BCTM), Direct Pore Scale Modeling (DPSM) and Pore Network Modeling (PNM), have appeared to be mostly widely adopted in the investigation of the pore-scale mechanics of fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions in porous media by numerical simulation. In this review article, a comprehensive review is provided to show their strengths and weaknesses and to highlight challenges that are faced in modelling of multiphase flow, key challenges include: are contact angle characterization, validation and upscale pore scale findings to core, or even field scale.},

The AEMFC could use non-platinum-group metal catalysts and less expensive metal hardware thanks to the high pH of the electrolyte. Over the last decade, substantial progress has been made in improving the performance and durability of the AEMFC through the development of new materials and the optimization of system design and operation conditions. In this perspective article, we describe the current status of AEMFCs as having reached beginning of life performance very close to that of PEMFCs when using ultra-low loadings of Pt, while advancing towards operation on non-platinum-group metal catalysts alone. In the latter sections, we identify the remaining technical challenges, which require further research and development, focusing on the materials and operational factors that critically impact AEMFC performance and/or durability. These perspectives may provide useful insights for the development of next-generation of AEMFCs.},

The model evaluates the total sodium mass in sodium-argon mixture released to the reactor containment building (RCB) through penetrations. The driving pressure at the penetration entrance is given as input. The two-phase frictional and local pressure drops, inertial and piezo-metric heads are accounted for in the model. Depending on the argon volume fraction, either a homogenous or separated flow approach is adopted to evaluate the mixture flow. Reactor-scale analysis show that the presence of argon in vessel head penetrations can significantly mitigate the total sodium release mass during the slug impact phase. Also, the two-phase frictional pressure drop plays a mitigating role and needs to be included in the model formulation to avoid overestimation of the sodium release mass. Fluid-structure interaction effects such as vessel head bending and hold-down bolt elongation have negligible influence on sodium release mass as long as the deformations are within the elastic limit. The model is conceived to be part of an integrated code system to evaluate the sodium fire and the maximum RCB pressure under severe accident conditions in a pool-type SFR.},

For the geometrical modelling of the PTL, two approaches were used: (a) modelling the exact geometry and (b) modelling a simplified geometry using a porosity model. Before conducting two-phase simulations, the model was validated using a single-phase approach. The Eulerian multiphase and the volume-of-fluid approaches were used for the two-phase modelling and the results were compared. Furthermore, a small section of the PTL was isolated to focus on the gas bubble flow and behaviour in more detail. The results showed plausible tendencies regarding pressure drop, velocity distribution and gas volume fraction distribution. The simplified geometry using the porous model could adequately replicate the results of the exact geometry model with a significant reduction in simulation time. The developed simulation model can be used for further investigations and gives insight into two-phase flow phenomena in the PTL. Additionally, the information obtained from simulation can aid the design and evaluation of new PTL structures.},

Thus, their dynamics are of crucial interest for the optimization of metallurgical processes. In this work, the state of knowledge of bubble dynamics at the bubble scale in liquid metals is reviewed. Measurement methods, with emphasis on liquid metals, are presented, and difficulties and shortcomings are analyzed. The bubble formation mechanism at nozzles and purging plugs is discussed. The uncertainty regarding the prediction of the bubble size distribution in real processes is demonstrated using the example of the steel casting ladle. Finally, the state of knowledge on bubble deformation and interfacial forces is summarized and the scalability of existing correlations to liquid metals is critically discussed. It is shown that the dynamics of bubbles, especially in liquid metals, are far from understood. While the drag force can be predicted reasonably well, there are large uncertainties regarding the bubble size distribution, deformation, and lift force. In particular, the influence of contaminants, which cannot yet be quantified in real processes, complicates the discussion and the comparability of experimental measurements. Further open questions are discussed and possible solutions are proposed.},

The accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of these data are evaluated using narrowband, \$10 keV, synchrotron radiation from the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the same flow conditions. It is found that the broadband X-ray tube source can be used for 2-D measurement of the equivalent path length (EPL) and 3-D CT imaging of liquid mass distribution with typical error of 5--10\%. Data are compared for cases with and without the use of potassium iodide (KI), which at 15\% concentration by mass increases the attenuation coefficient eightfold and enables 2-D and 3-D measurement of EPL with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5:1 down to 15 lm. At this concentration, the effects of energy-dependent attenuation (i.e., spectral beam hardening) are negligible for EPL up to 5 mm. Hence, the use of broadband X-ray tube sources is feasible for many practical engineering sprays with a dynamic range in EPL of \$330:1. The advantages and limitations of using broadband and narrowband X-ray sources are discussed, and recommendations for improving performance are presented.},

The results show the RTNR system correctly determines the void fraction distribution for each flow regime; however, accuracy decreases with decreasing void fraction. For net water thicknesses {$>$}1.0 cm, the accuracy decreases with increasing water thickness due to the extreme sensitivity of thermal neutron interactions with light water.

Foam texture (a measure of bubble volume) is a key parameter in determining the following properties of foam flowing through a capillary: (1) whether the foam exists as bulk foam or as a chain of bubbles where each pair of bubbles is separated by an individual lamella, (2) the number of lamellae per unit length of the capillary, and (3) the radius of curvature of the gas-liquid interface. The apparent viscosity is the sum of three contributions: (1) that from slugs of liquid between bubbles, (2) the resistance to deformation of the interface of a bubble passing through a capillary, and (3) the surface tension gradient that results when surface active material is swept from the front of a bubble and accumulates at the back of it.

  abstract = {Geomaterials and filling fluids properties that are pertinent to a geologic porous media can be characterized using a range of methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, X-rays, infrared spectroscopy, and neutron scattering (NS). In this context, NS features as an important tool elucidate key properties of a porous medium, which has recently gained significant attention. Key rock properties that can be measured by NS include: rock texture (i.e. crystallographic preferred orientation), mechanical properties (i.e. stress and strain) as well as porous medium properties (pore porosity, pore size and connectivity). In addition, NS imaging can help elucidate the phase behaviour of confined reservoir fluids in rock matrix under prevailing pressures and temperatures. Thus, a precise characterization of these properties (amongst other multiphase flow attributes) is critical for several applications in varied fields such as hydrocarbon reservoirs, geothermal systems, crystallography, geomechanics and geochemistry. Low neutron attenuation by most substances (deep sample penetration) and strong neutron attenuation by hydrogen are essential features of neutrons that allow NS to collect high-quality data across a wide variety of subsurface conditions. These features enable NS to be ideally suited to some applications as compared to other techniques such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For example, X-rays may not have sufficient resolutions for examining nanopore structures and confined fluids. Contrastingly, MRI is limited by the visualization of a range of pore sizes. However, NS can capture angstrom-to-micron-scale information of atomic to meso-to-macro-scale structures of rocks and fluids (i.e. hydrogen-rich fluids) inside a porous medium. These insights are vital for predictive reservoir models, where meaningful reservoir-scale (hectometre-scale) predictions can be performed. However, when compared to X-rays, neutrons have weak sources and/or low signals; therefore, experimental time can be quite long and samples need to be relatively large. Other limitations of NS (some may be also true of other techniques) include problems like accessing neutron sources (e.g. complicated nuclear processes for neutron production and small number of available instruments when compared to X-rays), high costs, and the strong absorption of neutron signals by some elements [e.g. cadmium (Cd), boron (B), and gadolinium (Gd)]. Despite the potential of NS, a review that considers key NS subsurface applications, limitations, and outlooks is currently lacking. Thus, in this review, we describe the basic concepts, experiments, methods, requirements, restrictions, and applications of NS for rock and fluid characterization. This study finds that despite its overall challenges, NS is a promising technique for characterizing subsurface rock and fluid systems, opening diverse avenues for future technological and scientific research within this area.},

  abstract = {The motion of a single bubble in a 2-D vertical channel filled with stagnant or moving fluid is simulated for various sets of conditions using the computational fluid dynamics(CFD) method. The volume of fluid (VOF) model is applied to track the interface of the bubble. Corresponding results are compared with experimental and theoretical studies, and good agreement is achieved. Two-phase flows composed of various fluids are simulated to check the impact of physical properties on bubble dynamics, and buoyancy is found to have a key influence on the bubble rising behavior, including both the trajectory and the terminal rising velocity. The dimensionless number Bu is introduced to characterize this effect, and a larger Bu leads to a larger bubble rising velocity. Three other dimensionless numbers Eo, We, and Mo are introduced to study the bubble deformation which can be characterized by aspect ratio E, and an approximately linear relationship is found between E, Eo, and bubble size. Inertial force is proved to influence the bubble motion significantly in moving fluid, whose velocity dominates the bubble terminal speed. The simulation of motion for two bubbles is also performed and investigated detailedly.},

Adding mesopores in the plane of ultrathin 2D metals is the next big step in manipulating these structures because increasing their surface area improves the utilization of the material and the availability of active sites. Here, we report a novel synthetic strategy to prepare an unprecedented type of 2D mesoporous metallic iridium (Ir) nanosheet. Mesoporous Ir nanosheets can be synthesized with close-packed assemblies of diblock copolymer (poly-(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene, PEO-b-PS) micelles aligned in the 2D plane of the nanosheets. This novel synthetic route opens a new dimension of control in the synthesis of 2D metals, enabling new kinds of mesoporous architectures with abundant catalytically active sites. Because of their unique structural features, the mesoporous metallic Ir nanosheets exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution as compared to commercially available catalysts.},

  abstract = {Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) is a highly potential and future-oriented equipment for hydrogen production. During its operation, gas hydrogen, oxygen and liquid water are all transported through the porous transport layer, and the gas-liquid two-phase flow transportation is a key factor for the performance of a PEMWE. However, the gas-liquid two-phase flow with a liquid fraction of up to 50\% through the porous transport layer is not well-researched yet. This thesis aims to study this flow through the open-porous foam in a model measurement cell. The non-invasion techniques of X-ray and neutron radiographic imaging are employed to visualize the flow condition. An algorithm is developed and tracks the moving bubbles and provides information on bubble velocities and bubble trajectories. The bubbles are found to have preferred paths through the foam. The bubble terminal velocity in the foam is generally lowest, compared with the theoretical solution of a single freely rising bubble and the terminal velocity of rising bubbles in bubble chains. The bubble velocities and trajectories are characterized by several experimental parameters. The relationship between the bubble diameter and the pore size is found to be significant for bubble behaviors through the foam. The impact of the air flow rate and nozzle size on the bubble behaviors is less significant. Further investigation on the effect of the material of the foam on the flow behavior is suggested.},

  abstract = {A microstructure-informed meso-scale model for diffusion of foreign species in porous media is proposed. The model is intended for media where the pore geometry data acquired experimentally represent a fraction of total porosity. A cellular complex, with a cell representing the average pore neighbourhood, is used to generate 3D graphs of sites at cell centres and bonds between neighbouring cells. The novel interpretation of pore systems as graphs allows for clear separation between topology (here connectedness) and physics (here diffusion) in the mathematical formulation of transport. Further, it allows for easy introduction of dynamics into the system, i.e., local changes in topology due to other physical mechanisms, such as micro-cracking or blockage of pores. A mapping between microstructure features and graph elements is used for model construction. The mapping is based on data for clays, where the experimentally resolved pore system comprises isolated elongated pores of preferred orientation with a large volume fraction of unresolved pores. Both the resolved and the ``hidden'' systems are accounted for. The graph geometry is described by a principal length, the cell size in the preferred orientation, and a secondary length, the cell size out of preferred orientation. This is considered as a representation of mineralogical heterogeneity of clays. Analysis on graphs, a specialisation of the discrete exterior calculus, is used to obtain connectivity and diffusivity properties of formed networks. Since the experimental data are not sufficient to determine the principal length, upper and lower limits are determined from the limited information. Effects of the principal cell size between limits and of the secondary cell size are studied. The results are within the range of experimentally measured macroscopic (bulk) diffusivity for the material studied, including anisotropic diffusion coefficients. The variation of calculated diffusivity coefficients with principal and secondary lengths provides an explanation for the variability in experimentally measured coefficients across different clays.},

  abstract = {Information regarding the flow in multi-phase systems, such as bubble columns, is necessary for the design of improved devices, as well as for the validation of computer models. Common optical methods are limited in bubble columns with a large void fraction. The reason that this should be is the difference in the refraction indices of liquid and gaseous phases, which leads to reflection and refraction of light. In addition, in flows without optical access, optical methods cannot be used. The method proposed by these authors in their previous paper regarding X-ray based particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)--called XPTV--resolves these problems. It allows us to measure the velocity three-dimensionally, non-invasive, and in devices without optical access. In bubble columns, X-rays are neither reflected nor refracted at the phase boundaries and the flow is penetrated in straight lines. Therefore, it works independently from the void fraction. This has been proved to be a reliable and useful measurement technique, circumventing the limitations of optical methods. This paper reports the latest improvements in the algorithms designed to track and reconstruct particles, a feature which is explained here in detail. The improved algorithms are applied to measure the hydrodynamic parameters in a bubble column under two different flow conditions.},

  abstract = {With pure hydrogen as the fuel, PEM fuel cell operation at or near 100\% fuel utilization is desirable to achieve a high stack efficiency and zero emissions. However, typical membranes used in PEM fuel cells allow a finite amount of permeation rates or crossover of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen across the membrane. The hydrogen and oxygen that permeate through the membrane are consumed with the generation of heat and water but without the generating of useful work, leading to a fuel inefficiency. Nitrogen crossover, on the other hand, from the cathode side to the anode side accumulates at the exit of the anode flow fields, lowering the hydrogen concentration and resulting in local fuel starvation. In this study, an in-situ electrochemical technique has been applied to determine the magnitude of the hydrogen crossover over a range of relevant fuel cell operating temperatures and pressures. Permeability coefficients thus obtained are compared to values reported in the literature. A mathematical model is developed to predict the extent of nitrogen accumulation along the anode flow fields, and fuel recycle as a mitigation method is simulated by improving hydrogen distribution. The model results were validated by comparison with experimental results. {\copyright} 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

A wealth of information is now compiled in the literature describing foam generation, destruction, and transport mechanisms. Yet there are conflicting views of these mechanisms and on the macroscopic results they produce. By critically reviewing how surfactant formulation and porous media topology conspire to control foam texture and flow resistance, we attempt to unify the disparate viewpoints. Evolution of texture during foam displacement is quantified by a population balance on bubble concentration, which is designed specifically for convenient incorporation into a standard reservoir simulator. Theories for the dominant bubble generation and coalescence mechanisms provide physically based rate expressions for the proposed population balance. Stone-type relative permeability functions along with the texture-sensitive and shear-thinning nature of confined foam complete the model. Quite good agreement is found between theory and new experiments for transient foam displacement in linear cores.},

The Serpent code was coupled to the Python script BBP to simulate batch-wise operation in a radially infinite inner core configuration; the ERANOS code was applied to the whole core geometry and the batch-wise operation was simulated by the EQL3D routine. Sodium void effect and Doppler constant spatial maps with different levels of refinement were produced, as well as the time evolution of the integral coefficients during the transition from initial cycle to equilibrium cycle. Both codes indicate deterioration of these coefficients during the transition. The equilibrium cycle performance of the inner core zone from the ERANOS calculation was compared with Serpent results and they showed reasonable agreement. For very fine mapping, the Monte Carlo method employed was computationally very demanding and the enumerated effect was lower than the stochastic noise. In general, the Serpent model practically excludes modeling assumptions and produces reliable results for reasonably sized maps, which can be combined if needed with the high spatial resolution results obtained by ERANOS simulations.},

  abstract = {The formation of gas bubbles and their subsequent rise due to buoyancy are very important fundamental phenomena that contribute significantly to the hydrodynamics in gas-liquid reactors. The rise of a bubble in dispersion can be associated with possible coalescence and dispersion followed by its disengagement from the system. The phenomenon of bubble formation decides the primitive bubble size in the system (which latter attains an equilibrium size), whereas the rise velocity decides the characteristic contact time between the phases which governs the interfacial transport phenomena as well as mixing. In view of their importance, we herein present a comprehensive review of bubble formation and bubble rise velocity in gas-liquid systems. The emphasis of this review is to illustrate the present status of the subjects under consideration and to highlight the possible future directions for further understanding of the subject. The bubble formation at a single submerged orifice and on multipoint sieve trays in Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian stagnant and flowing liquids is discussed in detail, which includes its mechanism as well as the effect of several system and operating parameters on the bubble size. The comparison of results has shown that the formulation of Gaddis and Vogelpohl22 is the most suitable for the estimation of bubble size in stagnant liquids. The special cases, such as bubble formation in reduced gravity conditions and weeping and in flowing liquids, are discussed in detail. The section on the rise of a gas bubble in liquid covers the various parameters governing bubble rise and their effect on the rise velocity. A comprehensive comparison of the various formulations is made by validating the predictions with experimental data for Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian liquids, published over last several decades. The results highlight that for the estimation of rise velocity in (i) pure Newtonian liquids, (ii) contaminated Newtonian liquids, and (iii) non-Newtonian liquids, the formulation based on the wave theory by Mendelson,190 Nguyen's formulation,155 and the formulation by Rodrigues,153 (last two, based on the dimensional analysis), respectively are the most suitable. The motion of bubbles in non-Newtonian liquids and the reason behind the discontinuity in the velocity are also discussed in detail. The bubble rise is also analyzed in terms of the drag coefficient for different system parameters and bubble sizes.},

In contrast to optical observations of foam flow in flat cells, the measurement depth equals 100 mm in the X-ray beam direction. Light-weight tracers of millimetric size and tetrapod-inspired shape are additively manufactured from stainless steel powder by selective laser melting. Matching with the foam structure and bubble size, these tracers follow the foam flow. An X-ray beam passes through the radiotransparent foam channel and is detected by an X-ray image intensifier. The X-ray transmission images show the two-dimensional projections of the radiopaque tracers. Utilizing particle tracking velocimetry algorithms, the tracer trajectories are measured with both high spatial (0.2 mm) and temporal (25 fps) resolution. Fine and coarse liquid foam flow of different velocities are studied in a partly curved channel with rectangular cross section. The simultaneous time-resolved measurements of the tracers' translational motion and their intrinsic rotation reveal both the local velocity and vorticity of the foam flow. In the semi-circular curved channel section, the rigid-body-like flow pattern is investigated. Moreover, a relaxation of the foam structure in the transition zone between straight and curved section is observed.},

  abstract = {Multi-phase flows of small solid particles and gas bubbles in optically opaque fluids play a key role in both mineral and metallurgical processing, which use the principle of froth flotation and bubble flotation, respectively. To gain visual insight into such particle-laden multi-phase flows, this dissertation investigates the application of radiographic techniques, employing both X-rays and neutron radiation. Lab-scale experiments are performed with model particles in liquid foams and liquid metals, focussing on the time-resolved measurement of the particles' motion in the multi-phase flows, aiming for a sufficient contrast-to-noise ratio in the X-ray or neutron image sequences.  The model experiments in this dissertation demonstrate the capabilities of X-ray and neutron radiography to image multi-phase flow in particle-laden and optically opaque fluids, especially to measure the motions of small particles with high spatial and temporal resolution. X-ray radiography enables to track custom-tailored tracer particles acting as tools for experimental investigations of flow phenomena in three-dimensional liquid foams. Both radiographic techniques supplement each other for imaging measurements of multi-phase flows with gas bubbles and solid particles in liquid metals. However, to visualise smallest model particles in liquid metal flows, neutron radiography proves to be the more promising technique compared to X-ray radiography. All in all, this dissertation contributes to paving the way for systematic radiographic measurements and further studies of particle-laden flows in optically opaque fluids.},

The second model predicts the binary bubble coalescence frequency as a function of the liquid viscosity, interfacial tension, bubble diameter, turbulent energy dissipation rate, and the surface immobility parameter. Favorable agreement between the breakage and coalescence models and the experimental evidence indicates that these models could be used to predict dispersion properties such as bubble size distributions and interfacial areas.},

Particularly, at the PTL-CL interface, our results reveal that laser ablated sintered titanium power-based PTLs improve electrolyzer performance at both the H2NEW Consortium baseline catalyst loading of 0.4 mgIr{$\cdot$}cm- 2 as well as at the ultra-low catalyst loading of 0.055 mgIr{$\cdot$}cm- 2. Under ultra-low catalyst loadings, the laser ablated PTL demonstrates maximum reduction of 230 mV compared to the commercial PTL at 4 A{$\cdot$}cm- 2, and reduces by 68 mV at 3.2 A{$\cdot$}cm- 2 under H2NEW baseline loading. Laser ablation alters the titanium phase at the interface, so it forms more uniform structure like a microporous layer or a backing layer, leading to an increase in the surface area in contact with the catalyst layer while preventing the membrane from deforming into the PTL. Moreover, we reveal that bulk-phase architecture modification of the PTL by ablating patterned pores at the flow field-PTL interface improves mass transport without sacrificing contact at the CL-PTL interface. Overall, laser ablation of the PTL is an effective method to customize interfacial design to enhance proton exchange membrane electrolyzer performance.},

Two stack designs that are commercially in use - one with and one without flow channels underneath the PTL - were tested and evaluated. Fundamental differences in performance have been observed between the two cell designs. Operation parameters only show impact on performance for the configuration without flow channels. Here, MTL were observed in several cases already for current densities around and above 1.0 A*cm-2. An increase in pressure, temperature or water flow rate reduces MTL for these configurations.},

The effect of surface contamination on diffusion is analyzed; bubble solution in the presence of contaminants is not greatly altered.

Compared to PEMFCs, the cost per unit of power can be significantly reduced for AEMFCs because, in theory, they allow the usage of non-precious metal catalysts and low-cost cell components. Owing to the development of advanced materials and performance improvement strategies, AEMFCs have achieved new records in both initial performance and durability. However, the high performance currently achieved is contingent on certain conditions, e. g., high Pt loading, large gas flowrates, and operation in pure O2, which are far from practical applications. Therefore, the transition to commercially relevant performance and durability is the next goal of AEMFCs. This paper reviews the performance data of H2-fueled AEMFCs since 2010 and summarizes possible performance optimization schemes, which can provide useful insights for developing next-generation AEMFCs.},

In our experimental work, we investigated visually the morphological configurations of gas bubbles migration, fragment, coalescence and trapping in different liquid-simulated porous media packs of glass beads. Also, the volume fraction of the trapped gas bubbles in the drainage process were measured. A fast video recording technique was used for the visual observations of the morphological characteristics of the rising gas bubbles in the saturated porous media. The obtained experimental images recorded reveal three types of the rising migration bubbles namely: free migration in the pore throat, attached wall migration on the beads and deformation migration. Additionally, coalescence and fragment have an interdependency for a rising gas bubble. The adsorption and capillary trappings are both two kinds of important trapping mechanisms, which determine the volume fraction of the trapped bubbles. The volume fraction of the trapped bubbles increases with an increment in the gas injection time and rates with the trapped bubbles fluctuating upward and downward due to the more coalescence and fragment after a long gas injection time/period. Lastly, the volume fraction of the trapped bubbles increases with a decrease in the inclination angles and porosities, which influences the areal sweep efficiency for enhanced liquid recovery in a porous media.},

As liquid viscosity reduces, bubble rising trajectory changes from one-dimensional to three-dimensional. This transition is due to different bubble wake structures. The bubble shapes also show dissimilar characteristics in liquid of different viscosities. The instantaneous liquid flow fields measured by PIV show the diversities as bubbles rise in different paths. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study, a correlation is proposed to calculate the terminal velocity of bubbles in a chain.},

We show that all the data can be accurately compared together if the dimensionless permeability of the foam is plotted as a function of liquid fraction. Using this set of coordinates highlights the fact that a large part of the published experimental results corresponds to relatively wet foams (epsilon approximately 0.1). Yet, most of the foam drainage models are based on geometrical considerations only valid for dry foams. We therefore discuss the range of validity of the different models in the literature and their comparison to experimental data. We propose extensions of these models considering the geometry of foam in the relatively wet-foam limit. We eventually show that if the foam geometry is correctly described, forced drainage experiments can be understood using a unique parameter --the Boussinesq number.},

  abstract = {Tandem photo-electro-chemical cells composed of an assembly of a solid electrolyte membrane and two low-cost photoelectrodes have been developed to generate green solar fuel from water-splitting. In this regard, an anion-exchange polymer--electrolyte membrane, able to separate H2 evolved at the photocathode from O2 at the photoanode, was investigated in terms of ionic conductivity, corrosion mitigation, and light transmission for a tandem photo-electro-chemical configuration. The designed anionic membranes, based on polysulfone polymer, contained positive fixed functionalities on the side chains of the polymeric network, particularly quaternary ammonium species counterbalanced by hydroxide anions. The membrane was first investigated in alkaline solution, KOH or NaOH at different concentrations, to optimize the ion-exchange process. Exchange in 1M KOH solution provided high conversion of the groups, a high ion-exchange capacity (IEC) value of 1.59 meq/g and a hydroxide conductivity of 25 mS/cm at 60 {$^\circ$}C for anionic membrane. Another important characteristic, verified for hydroxide membrane, was its transparency above 600 nm, thus making it a good candidate for tandem cell applications in which the illuminated photoanode absorbs the highest-energy photons ({$<$} 600 nm), and photocathode absorbs the lowest-energy photons. Furthermore, hydrogen crossover tests showed a permeation of H2 through the membrane of less than 0.1\%. Finally, low-cost tandem photo-electro-chemical cells, formed by titanium-doped hematite and ionomer at the photoanode and cupric oxide and ionomer at the photocathode, separated by a solid membrane in OH form, were assembled to optimize the influence of ionomer-loading dispersion. Maximum enthalpy (1.7\%), throughput (2.9\%), and Gibbs energy efficiencies (1.3\%) were reached by using n-propanol/ethanol (1:1 wt.) as solvent for ionomer dispersion and with a 25 {\textmu}L cm-2 ionomer loading for both the photoanode and the photocathode.},

The returning flow branches off from the free surface and re-submerges at the border of the swollen surface.

The conditions necessary for gas entrainment in a simple system are examined experimentally, using water and air as working fluids. The effect of surface tension is examined by adding a surface active agent to the water. The results show that gas entrainment inception is determined by the flow pattern in the system and the product of the Froude and Weber numbers based on the local velocity at the bubble formation point.},

In this study, the migration and trapping of gas bubbles are simulated using the pore-network model extracted from the 3D X-ray image of in situ sediment. Two types of bubble size distribution (mono-sized and distributed-sized cases) are used in the simulation. The spatial and statistical bubble size distribution, residual gas saturation, and hydraulic conductivity reduction due to the bubble trapping are investigated. The results show that the bubble size distribution becomes wider during the gas bubble migration due to bubble coalescence for both mono-sized and distributed-sized cases. And the trapped bubble fraction and the residual gas saturation increase as the bubble size increases. The hydraulic conductivity is reduced as a result of the gas bubble trapping. The reduction in hydraulic conductivity is apparently observed as bubble size and the number of nucleation points increase.},

  abstract = {In the process of film condensation in a porous medium, the thermodynamics of phase equilibria requires the existence of a two-phase zone lying between the liquid and the vapor regions. In the two-phase zone, solutions of the conservation equations indicate a boundary-layer profile for the capillary pressure. The liquid zone is analyzed using three models, which assume either slip or no slip at the wall and Darcy velocity or no shear at the interface with the two-phase zone. The results show that the condition of no slip at the wall must be satisfied in all cases except where the thickness of the liquid zone is much larger than the characteristic boundary layer in the porous medium. At the interface with the two-phase zone, the assumption of no shear is more realistic than that of an imposed Darcy velocity, in conjunction with no-slip condition at the wall. Comparisons with experiments suggest that the drag on the liquid film due to surface tension is significant for permeabilities lower than 10-7 m2. A dimensionless group, characterizing viscous flow due to surface tension forces, is introduced in this study.},

Specifically, in these proof-of-concept experiments we examined a Poiseuille flow, flow through porous media and a multiphase flow with a Taylor bubble. For a full 360\$\$\^{}{\textbackslash}circ\$\$computed tomography (CT) scan we show that the specially selected 60 micron tracer particles could be imaged in less than 3 seconds with a signal-to-noise ratio between the tracers and the fluid of 2.5, sufficient to achieve proper volumetric segmentation at each time step. In the pipe flow, continuous Lagrangian particle trajectories were obtained, after which all the standard techniques used for PTV or PIV (taken at visible wave lengths) could also be employed for TXPTV data. And, with TXPTV we can examine flows inaccessible with visible wave lengths due to opaque media or numerous refractive interfaces. In the case of opaque porous media we were able to observe material accumulation and pore clogging, and for flow with Taylor bubble we can trace the particles and hence obtain velocities in the liquid film between the wall and bubble, with thickness of liquid film itself also simultaneously obtained from the volumetric reconstruction after segmentation. While improvements in scan speed are anticipated due to continuing improvements in CT system components, we show that for the flows examined even the presently available CT systems could yield quantitative flow data with the primary limitation being the quality of available flow tracers.},

  abstract = {The safety assessment of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors (SFR) requires to account for hypothetical severe accidents involving the melting down of the core materials. This paper deals with the modeling of a fuel vaporization transient that might occur in a SFR in case of severe accident. After a nuclear power excursion, some fuel might be molten and vaporized. In this case, the expansion of fuel vapor might generate a mechanical stress on the reactor vessel and structures. Assessing the vessel integrity is of major importance for the reactor design. A fuel vaporization and expansion modeling, which has been simplified using a Dimensional Analysis, is presented. The modeling is implemented in a tool, called DETONa, able to perform fast calculations, of the order of one minute. The vaporized fuel's thermal exchange with the reactor liquid coolant leading to a possible coolant vaporization is simulated by DETONa. The coolant is assumed to be entrained into the fuel vapor. A droplet entrainment model based on Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities associated to their diameter's limitation using Weber stability criterion is proposed. The modeling is validated on experimental results and on code-to-code comparisons. Parametric calculations are conducted on a reactor case. The impact of the initial molten fuel mass, its initial temperature, critical Weber number and radiative heat transfer are investigated. The non-adiabatic modeling and the adiabatic modeling yield results different by 40\% in certain cases. DETONa is shown to be sensitive to the fuel initial temperature, the heat transfer coefficient and the Rayleigh-Taylor wavelength, involving variations that can range to 18\%.},

Measurements made in distilled water showed that the increase of velocity with frequency dropped off with bubble size until it was negligible for the smaller bubbles. It was shown that the variation of bubble velocity with frequency and size can be fairly well correlated with the velocity of rise of solitary bubbles by means of a model based on turbulent wake theory. Tap-water measurements showed the same effect of impurities in the water on the bubble rise velocity as had been observed for solitary bubbles; however, the bubble radius at which the effect became apparent decreased with frequency. Measurements made in sugar water showed that the effect of fluid properties on the rise velocity decreased as frequency increased. At the highest frequencies, no difference could be seen between the distilled water and the sugar water rise velocity curves.},

However, applications of CEMs suffer from a number of disadvantages such as requirement of costly platinum catalyst, and high crossover of fuels or positively charged redox species due to the electro-osmotic drag. Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have shown promising characteristics to overcome some of the problems associated with CEMs; the advantages of AEMs being selective transport anionic charge carriers, lower crossover of cationic redox couples, and facile reaction kinetics in energy conversion processes. These unique properties of AEMs result mainly from the density and distribution of positively charged functional groups, along with a macromolecular polymer backbone. As a result, there has been an increasing demand for the development of AEMs with better selectivity, higher chemical stability and conductivity, and a lot of work have been carried out in this area. The aim of this review is to discuss developments in the synthesis and applications of AEMs in the field of electrochemical energy conversion and storage, on which many researchers are working in recent years.},

This transition is apparently due to a change from viscous to inviscid flow. It is also known that the inviscid flow regime can be further subdivided into surface tension- (Weber number) and buoyancy- (Froude number) dominated regimes. This behavior of rising bubbles is strikingly similar to the behavior of surface waves propagated over deep water. The analogy is found to be in quantitative agreement when the wavelength is suitably interpreted in terms of bubble dimensions. The inference of this analogy is that bubbles may be thought of as interfacial disturbances whose rate of propagation is governed by the well-known laws of wave motion.},

  abstract = {The advancing wetting conditions of porous media by various kinds of pure liquids was considered theoretically based on Fowkes' dispersion theory and capillary rise equation. It was then hypothesized that the wettability and repellency under the advancing process can be characterized in terms of the advancing spreading coefficient, and could be predicted from the data of liquid surface tension and of solid-air surface tension of porous media. Experimental data within the contact angle wetting (0{$<\theta$}a{$<$}90{$^\circ$}) in soil and sand samples with several organic liquids and water indicated reasonably good agreement to the theory. Based on this agreement new methods---surface tension and liquid drop---were proposed to determine the solid-air surface tension. These methods were found to be workable for appreciable range of water-repellent porous media.},

  abstract = {In recent years, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have regained worldwide attention from academia, industries, investors, and governments. The prospect of PEM fuel cells has turned into reality, with fuel cell vehicles successfully launched in the market. However, today's fuel cells remain less competitive than combustion engines and batteries, primarily due to their high cost and short lifetime, which are significantly affected by the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), or the ``chips'' of PEM fuel cells. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to developing advanced materials and manufacturing processes for MEAs. In this paper, we critically review the recent progress of key materials for MEAs, focusing on how to integrate materials into electrodes and MEAs. We also present the most advanced designs and manufacturing techniques of MEAs and discuss their possible constraints. Finally, perspectives on future R\&D directions of materials and MEAs are provided. This review aims to bridge the gaps between academic material research and industrial manufacturing process development.},

  abstract = {The partitioning of volatile non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) compounds to a discontinuous gas phase can result in the expansion of that gas phase, and the resulting gas flow can significantly affect the mass transfer from NAPL source zones. This recently reported gas flow generated by the spontaneous expansion of a discontinuous gas phase has not been extensively characterized in the literature. This study measured the expansion rate of a single gas cluster in a 1.1mm sand above a pool of trans-1,2-dichloroethene (tDCE) in small-scale flow cell experiments. To characterize the gas flow, gas injection experiments in three sizes of sand were conducted at very slow injection rates typical of gas flow rates produced by gas expansion due to NAPL partitioning. Gas cluster spontaneous expansion rates above a tDCE pool were found to be 0.34{\textpm}0.02 and 0.29{\textpm}0.01mL/day in duplicate experiments, which is sufficiently slow to result in discontinuous gas flow in porous media with a grain size diameter greater than 0.02mm. Measured capillary pressures during gas injection showed patterns consistent with discontinuous gas flow, and identified multiple fragmentation events and expansion by coalescence with trapped clusters. The combination of pressure data and light transmission images were used to identify fragmentation and obtain direct measurements of the critical cluster length (i.e. the length at which withdrawal of the gas phase from a pore space occurs) in quasi-two-dimensional porous media for the first time. The measured critical cluster lengths were 1.4--3.6, 3.2--6.0 and 2.8--6.5cm in 1.1, 0.7 and 0.5mm sands, respectively. These values agreed well with estimates of the critical cluster length made using previously reported equations, and parameters derived from the medium's capillary pressure-saturation relationship.},

However, if the explosives have similar macroscopic cross sections to neutrons, characterising them is not possible. In this investigation, an attempt is made to distinguish various explosives based on the attenuation cross section of these compounds to neutrons. A correlation between the grey level achieved in neutron image of each explosive taken in a thin walled shell and their corresponding macroscopic attenuation cross section is carried out. An attempt is made to study the possibility of detection of some low dense compounds kept inside pyro metallic cases using cone beam X-ray 3D computed tomography. X-ray CT sliced images of samples filled with calcium carbonate and epoxy can be easily distinguished from empty samples. Samples were tested in NR and X-ray CT facility to compare the results. It is observed that low dense compounds of small volume positioned inside a bulk volume of SS metal of a pyro element used in this study are giving sufficient contrast that makes it detectable in CT cross-sectional image. The study points towards usage of X-ray CT as an alternative tool for detecting the presence of explosives in pyro devices wherever NR imaging cannot be carried out due to wall thickness constraints.},

As of 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency reports there are 422 nuclear power reactors and 223 nuclear research reactors in operation around the world.In the early era of nuclear reactors (1940s), a reactor was known as a nuclear pile or atomic pile (so-called because the graphite moderator blocks of the first reactor to reach criticality were stacked in a pile).},

Measurements were performed to investigate the dynamics of bubble coalescence under well-defined laboratory conditions. Air and pure aqueous solutions of alginate (no surfactants) were the phases. The bubbles were formed from two vertical capillaries, under constant flow conditions. The coalescence process was recorded with a fast video and then image analysed, to evaluate the bubble growth, bubble expansion rate, the first bubble touch, bubble contact time T, bubble coalescence efficiency E. Three control parameters were tested. The bubble size D on contact was set by the spacing between the capillaries (D{$\frac{1}{4}$}1 and 1.5 mm). The bubble approach velocity V was controlled by the gas input (V{$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.031--39 mm/s). The liquid viscosity {$\mu$} was adjusted by the alginate content ({$\mu\frac{1}{4}$}1.2--10.3 mPa s). It was found that the bubble contact time T monotonously increases with the liquid viscosity, passing through three stages: initial rise (low {$\mu$}, coalescence), then jump (intermediate {$\mu$}, transient region), and finally forming a plateau (high {$\mu$}, noncoalescence). In the coalescent regime, the bubble contact time monotonously decreases with the bubble approach velocity obeying a power law, which for a typical 1 mm bubble reads: T{$\sim$}V 0.85. The difference in the bubble size did not change the coalescence pattern qualitatively, but only quantitatively in a modest manner.},

Hydrogen development should also meet the seventh goal of `affordable and clean energy' of the United Nations. Here we review hydrogen production and life cycle analysis, hydrogen geological storage and hydrogen utilisation. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis, steam methane reforming, methane pyrolysis and coal gasification. We compare the environmental impact of hydrogen production routes by life cycle analysis. Hydrogen is used in power systems, transportation, hydrocarbon and ammonia production, and metallugical industries. Overall, combining electrolysis-generated hydrogen with hydrogen storage in underground porous media such as geological reservoirs and salt caverns is well suited for shifting excess off-peak energy to meet dispatchable on-peak demand.},

  abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers (PEM-WEs) are electrochemical devices increasing in popularity and are commonly used to produce hydrogen with at least a pureness of 99.9\% from water. Computational fluid dynamics is essential in PEM electrolyzer research. Most numerical models based on the electrolysis process have been developed considering a steady-state and single-phase flow. Two-phase simulation models of the anode side of the PEM-WE were generally generated using volume-of-fluid and Eulerian approaches. This study contributes to the existing discussion related to the two-phase modeling approaches. A three-dimensional mixture-approached viscosity model of the PEM-WE is developed to characterize the two-phase flow in the flow field plate. The finite-volume method was used to solve the time-dependent, isothermal model coupled within a laminar regime, oxygen defining the dispersed phase and the water the continuous phase. The two-phase flow characteristic has been investigated with the mixture model approach. The effect of the number of channels on the pressure drop behavior, velocity profile, and oxygen concentration distribution will make a novel contribution to the literature. The numerical results show that as the number of channels increases, the oxygen concentration increases, and the pressure drop decreases. It was concluded that the oxygen gas volume fraction, which is the highest at the center of the flow field plate, increases from the channel inlet to the channel outlet. This paper will give the electrolyzer cell or stack manufacturer a practical perspective before the product development.},

X-ray computed tomography (CT) is considered an ideal candidate for providing the critically needed metrology on the smallest scales, especially internal features, or inaccessible regions. X-ray CT supporting micro- and nanomanufacturing often push against the poorly understood resolution and variation limits inherent to the machines, which can distort or hide fine structures. We develop and experimentally verify a comprehensive analytical uncertainty propagation signal variation flow graph (SVFG) model for X-ray radiography in this work to better understand resolution and image variability limits on the small scale. The SVFG approach captures, quantifies, and predicts variations occurring in the system that limit metrology capabilities, particularly in the micro/nanodomain. This work is the first step to achieving full uncertainty modeling of CT reconstructions and provides insight into improving X-ray attenuation imaging systems. The SVFG methodology framework is applied to generate a complete basis set of functions describing the major sources of variation in radiographs. Five models are identified, covering variation in energy, intensity, length, blur, and position. Radiographic system experiments are defined to measure the parameters required by the SVFGs. Best practices are identified for these measurements. The SVFG models are confirmed via direct measurement of variation to predict variation within 30\% on average.},

With a sentiment of this, most researchers are now directing either on non-conventional resources that already prevail or invent it. The most promising non-conventional energy resource is the hydrogen energy, which can be used in fuel cell to get electricity. Therefore, a number of researchers are putting a light on developing the most efficient and affordable fuel cell. This review is mainly focused on the developments of proton exchange membranes (PEMs) in two parts as low and high temperature PEMs for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and based on that some outperformed PEMs are mentioned in the respective tables. Most of the energy and automobile industries are concentrating to apply PEMFCs for power generation and to apply in vehicles. The cost of PEMFCs is higher due to the manufacturing cost of PEM. Therefore, research works in PEMs are now in trend to reduce the cost, to improve efficiency, and to withstand particular operating conditions. In this review article, recent developments in PEM by number of researchers and the importance of it in near future have been elicited.},

  abstract = {A titanium Porous Transport Layer (PTL) is usually used at the anode side of PEM water electrolyzers to ensure both the gas/water transport and the electric charges transfer. In this paper, four different sintered Ti powder PTLs were characterized to determine some properties, such as the pore size distribution, the porosity, and the permeability. Their influence on the electrolysis performance was investigated by using a 30~cm2 segmented cell which allowed measuring the current density distribution, while controlling temperature and pressure conditions. For a better understanding, in-situ techniques such as the Polarization Curves and the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used. A local characterization of mass transport limitations caused by oxygen saturation was carried out, paying special attention to the pressure influence when using a PTL with very small pores. The results showed that current density heterogeneities can be explained by microstructure changes along the PTL. The optimal geometric characteristics of the PTL depend not only on the operating conditions such as current density, pressure, and temperature but also on the catalyst layer properties. A new model for the constriction resistance between the catalyst layer and the PTL was proposed.},

  abstract = {Gas entrainment in pool type sodium cooled fast breeder reactors has been a subject of great interest for a quite long time now. The issue of entrainment of argon cover gas in LMFBR's is being addressed by fundamental studies. Present work focuses on characterization of onset of shear type entrainment and liquid fall type entrainment based on mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy at liquid surface. Study also includes characterization of onset of vortex type entrainment based on mean velocities (time averaged) in the outlet pipe. Experiments were carried out to characterize shear type entrainment in stirred tank with different impeller geometries with air--water and xylene--water systems. Onset of liquid fall type entrainment was studied with cylindrical tank with a nozzle whose input angle varied. Mean and r.m.s. velocity profiles near the liquid surface were measured with the help of ultrasonic velocity profiler (UVP). The results are compared with other literature. It is observed that the onset of entrainment can be characterized by the turbulent kinetic energy near the free liquid surface. Re-submergence angle was measured and r.m.s. velocities found to be in the same range as in case of shear type of entrainment. Cylindrical tank with tangential inlet and bottom outlet was used to study onset of vortex formation. Effect of different parameters like outlet diameter, tank diameter and liquid height in the tank on critical velocity was studied and correlation has been proposed.},

  abstract = {X-ray attenuation measurements are commonly used as a non-destructive method to monitor internal concentration changes of moisture (i.e., moisture content) and other chemical compounds in porous building materials. The technique provides direct measurements of moisture content changes through analysis with a composite model consisting of a dry porous material and a thickness of water equivalent to the moisture content of the material. The current formulation of this composite model relies on certain assumptions, including a monochromatic X-ray photon beam source (i.e., X-ray photons of a single, consistent energy) and that interactions between the X-ray photons and the materials (water and porous material) are independent. However, X-ray sources typically used by researchers in this field of study produce X-ray photon beams over a spectrum of energy levels, or polychromatic X-ray photons. Implications of this inconsistency are introduced and discussed. This paper presents both an overview of fundamental descriptions of the X-ray attenuation measurement technique and results from a parametric experimental study of various porous construction materials, including calcium silicate board, aerated autoclaved concrete, clay brick, cementitious materials, and wood. Results from the parametric investigation indicate the attenuation coefficient of water is dependent on the type and thickness of the porous material.},

  abstract = {Purpose: X-ray dark-field imaging promises information on the small angle scattering properties even of large samples. However, the dark-field image is correlated with the object's attenuation and phase-shift if a polychromatic x-ray spectrum is used. A method to remove part of these correlations is proposed. Methods: The experimental setup for image acquisition was modeled in a wave-field simulation to quantify the dark-field signals originating solely from a material's attenuation and phase-shift. A calibration matrix was simulated for ICRU46 breast tissue. Using the simulated data, a dark-field image of a human mastectomy sample was corrected for the finger print of attenuation- and phase-image. Results: Comparing the simulated, attenuation-based dark-field values to a phantom measurement, a good agreement was found. Applying the proposed method to mammographic dark-field data, a reduction of the dark-field background and anatomical noise was achieved. The contrast between microcalcifications and their surrounding background was increased. Conclusions: The authors show that the influence of and dispersion can be quantified by simulation and, thus, measured image data can be corrected. The simulation allows to determine the corresponding dark-field artifacts for a wide range of setup parameters, like tube-voltage and filtration. The application of the proposed method to mammographic dark-field data shows an increase in contrast compared to the original image, which might simplify a further image-based diagnosis.

Specifically, it is demonstrated why and when PTV is the natural choice in 3D applications compared to particle image velocimetry (PIV). Three different tracking methods are investigated, namely the nearest neighbour, the neural network and the relaxation method. In order to demonstrate the use of PTV for 3D applications, the selected tracking schemes are implemented for use with the defocusing digital particle image velocimetry (DDPIV) technique. The performance of the tracking algorithms is evaluated based on synthetic 3D information. Furthermore, the potential benefit of a merging between the PIV and PTV approaches is explored within the DDPIV framework. The results show that the relaxation tracking method is the most robust and efficient, while the combined PIV/PTV analysis brings significant improvements solely with the neural network scheme. In terms of errors, PTV is found to be more sensitive to particle reconstruction errors than the DDPIV cross-correlation analysis.},

Theoretical developments and recent experimental results have suggested that two macroscopic drainage regimes could be expected, in relation with flow transitions occurring at the microscopic level, essentially in the Plateau border channels. We have constructed a setup, the Plateau border apparatus, to study the hydrodynamics of a single Plateau border channel, focusing on the surface properties of the foaming solution. Experimental results have shown that the actual theoretical models only partially predict the dissipation of liquid flow through a Plateau border channel. The major discrepancies can be explained considering additional dissipation processes related to the properties of the interface, and to the liquid flows induced in adjoining films as the liquid flows in the channel. Evidence of the hydrodynamic coupling between the channel and the adjoining films is given in the paper.}

Simulation research was performed to dynamically characterize bubble generation, growth and bursting in flowing sodium, and experimental research was conducted to explore the time-frequency and time domain statistical characteristics of bubble signals. After gas injection, significant low-amplitude signals were observed in the time domain, the power spectral density fluctuated in the 0--20\,kHz band; its spectral components were more abundant above 8\,kHz, and the short-time Fourier transform of the energy spectrum exhibited a nonlinear intermittent distribution in the 8--20\,kHz band. Based on these differences, the bubble signal was effectively detected when the gas injection rate was 0.11\,m3/h with a signal-to-noise ratio less than 0.5\,dB. Thus, this study complemented the present techniques and knowledge in the field of chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {Inter-wrapper flow (IWF) is a typical thermal hydraulic phenomenon that exists in narrow gaps among the adjacent assemblies of a liquid metal fast reactor (LMFR) that can dissipate heat from assemblies and transfer heat among adjacent assemblies. Moreover, when blocked or reduced flow accidents occur, the IWF has a sig\- nificant effect on reactor safety, especially reducing the peak cladding temperature. In this study, a computa\- tional fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the Karlsruhe liquid metal laboratory IWF experimental setup (called MYRRHA design) is built. The model contains three fuel assemblies with seven rods using lead--bismuth eutectic as working fluid. The new mesh generation method, correlation of turbulence model, and fluid--solid coupling heat transfer were considered in the CFD model. The established model was initially validated, and the simu\- lation results were found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The influence of IWF on the thermal hydraulic characteristics within the rod bundle was revealed. The results indicated that the IWF rate can affect the heat transfer capability of the bundle under. The amount of heat removed increased by up to 10\% with the IWF rate in a single bundle. The occurrence of IWF reduces the wall surface temperature and appropriately balances the temperature of adjacent bundles; however, it cannot effectively reduce the peak temperature of the cladding. The complex heat transfer characteristics and flow mechanism under the influence of IWF and wire mixing were revealed. The work presented in this paper represents an important step toward the IWF research on blocked flow scenarios.},

Unlike conventional alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE), AEMWEs utilize mild alkaline conditions and anion exchange membranes as separators and ionic conductors, respectively. However, the largest merit of AEMWE is the utilization of low-cost transition metals as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Achieving excellent AEMWE performance using highly active and robust transition metal electrocatalysts is desired for lowering the fabrication cost and realizing the successful commercialization of AEMWE. Water splitting efficiency in the AEMWE largely depends on the kinetics of the HER and OER catalysts. Such a condition requires proper understanding of the reaction mechanisms, careful design and optimization of catalyst materials, and maintenance of catalyst durability under AEMWE conditions during long-term operation. This review discussed recent transition metal HER, OER, and bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts applied within the actual AEMWE membrane electrode assembly (MEA), where their influence toward the electrolyzer cell performance is highlighted. Additionally, the MEA fabrication methods are briefly addressed. From the review, potential electrocatalyst materials and remaining challenges are identified to provide for future improvements on the AEMWE system.},

  abstract = {Bubble dynamics in porous media are of great importance in industrial and natural systems. Of particular significance is the impact that bubble-related emissions (ebullition) of greenhouse gases from porous media could have on global climate (e.g., wetland methane emissions). Thus, predictions of future changes in bubble storage, movement, and ebullition from porous media are needed. Methods exist to predict ebullition using numerical models, but all existing models are limited in scale (spatial and temporal) by high computational demands or represent porous media simplistically. A suitable model is needed to simulate ebullition at scales beyond individual pores or relatively small collections ({$<$}10-4 m3) of connected pores. Here we present a cellular automaton model of bubbles in porous media that addresses this need. The model is computationally efficient, and could be applied over large spatial and temporal extent without sacrificing fine-scale detail. We test this cellular automaton model against a physical model and find a good correspondence in bubble storage, bubble size, and ebullition between both models. It was found that porous media heterogeneity alone can have a strong effect on ebullition. Furthermore, results from both models suggest that the frequency distributions of number of ebullition events per time and the magnitude of bubble loss are strongly right skewed, which partly explains the difficulty in interpreting ebullition events from natural systems.},

  abstract = {We rigorously derive a formula for the terminal velocity of a small bubble in a vertically vibrated viscous incompressible liquid starting from the full Navier-Stokes equations and the exact boundary conditions at the bubble surface. This formula is derived using a perturbation analysis in which the small parameter is the nondimensional amplitude of the pressure oscillation. The analysis does not assume that the bubble remains spherical but does assume that the bubble is axisymmetric. It is shown that the bubble terminal velocity can be computed to second order while computing the full solution only to first order by applying a compatibility condition on the first-order solution. To second order, the bubble terminal velocity is shown to be the net value from an upward steady term and a rectified term that can be downward or upward. The perturbation formula depends on the vibration frequency nondimensionalized by the bubble radius and the liquid kinematic viscosity. We show that our perturbation formula links two heuristically developed formulas for the rectified component, which we denote the velocity-averaged and force-averaged formulas. Our perturbation formula reproduces the velocity-averaged formula for low frequencies and the forced-averaged formula for high frequencies and varies monotonically between these limits for intermediate frequencies. We furthermore develop a high-resolution spectral code specifically to simulate this type of bubble motion. Results from this code verify that the perturbation formula is correct for infinitesimal oscillating pressure amplitudes and suggest that it provides an upper bound for finite amplitudes of the pressure oscillation.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion layers (GDL) are one of the important parts of the PEM fuel cell as they serve to transport the reactant gases to the catalyst layer. Porosity of this layer has a large effect on the PEM fuel cell performance. The spatial variation in porosity arises due to two effects: (1) compression of the electrode on the solid landing areas and (2) water produced at the cathode side of gas diffusion layers. Both of these factors change the porosity of gas diffusion layers and affect the fuel cell performance. To implement this performance analysis, a mathematical model which considers oxygen and hydrogen mass fraction in gas diffusion layer and the electrical current density in the catalyst layer, and the fuel cell potentials are investigated. The porosity variation in the GDL is calculated by considering the applied pressure and the amount of the water generated in the cell. The validity of the model is approved by comparing the computed results with experimental data. The obtained results show that the decrease in the average porosity causes the reduction in oxygen consumption, so that a lower electrical current density is generated. It is also shown that when the electrical current density is low, the porosity variation in gas diffusion layer has no significant influence on the level of polarization whereas at higher current density the influence is very significant. The porosity variation causes non-uniformity in the mass transport which in turn reduces the current density and a lower fuel cell performance is obtained.},

These bubbles are not spherical but are, approximately, oblate spheroids ; and they may rise steadily in a vertical straight line, or along a zig-zag path, or in a uniform spiral. The rectilinear motion occurs when the radius is less than about 0.7 mm, and the other motions occur for larger bubbles. There is disagreement in the literature as to whether it is the zig-zag or the spiral motion that occurs. It was found experimentally that, when the bubbles are produced in the manner described in this paper, only the zig-zag motion occurs when the radius of the bubble is less than about 1 mm, but bubbles of larger radius either zig-zag or spiral depending upon various factors.},

  abstract = {The motion of a single nitrogen gas bubble chain and the structure of water flow field surrounding the chain were experimentally studied. We developed a bubble generator that can control both the bubble diameter and the generation frequency independently. Experimental conditions of bubble Reynolds number and bubble distance divided by bubble diameter were from 300 to 650 and from 6.5 to 300, respectively. We discuss the interaction effects on the motion of each bubble rising in a chain, as compared to the effects of a single rising bubble. The bubble trajectories and the surrounding water flow fields in the state of bubbles rising in a chain were investigated using a high-speed digital video camera and an analog single-lens-reflex camera. We observed two important physical phenomena. First, bubbles passed through a nearly identical path in the case of low frequency of bubble production. On the contrary, at a height of approximately 50 mm from the nozzle, the bubbles in the case of high frequency deviated and scattered from this path due to bubble--bubble interaction. Second, with higher bubble production frequency, coherent bubble chain and the characteristic structure of the surrounding water flow called ``liquid jet'' were observed near the nozzle. The direction of liquid jet flow differed from the bubble trajectory. We theoretically investigated the relation of coherent bubble chain and liquid jet by applying the conservation of liquid momentum.},

Two-phase transport in an electrolyzer cell is visualized by simultaneous neutron radiography and optical imaging. Optical and neutron data are used in a complementary manner to aid in understanding the two-phase flow behavior. Two different patterns of gas-bubble evolution and departure are identified: periodic growth/removal of small bubbles vs. prolonged blockage by stagnant large bubbles. In addition, the bubble distribution across the active area is not uniform due to combined effects of buoyancy and proximity to the inlet. The effects of operating parameters such as current density, temperature and water flow rate on the two-phase distribution are investigated. Higher water accumulation is detected in the cathode chamber at higher current density, even though the cathode is purged with a high flow rate of N2.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is the most efficient energy carrier. Hydrogen can be obtained from different sources of raw materials including water. Among many hydrogen production methods, eco-friendly and high purity of hydrogen can be obtained by water electrolysis. However, In terms of sustainability and environmental impact, PEM water electrolysis was considered as most promising techniques for high pure efficient hydrogen production from renewable energy sources and emits only oxygen as byproduct without any carbon emissions. Moreover, the produced hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) directly used for fuel cell and industrial applications. However, overall water splitting resulting in only 4\% of global industrial hydrogen being produced by electrolysis of water, mainly due to the economic issues. Nowadays, increased the desire production of green hydrogen has increased the interest on PEM water electrolysis. Thus the considerable research has been completed recently in the development of cost effective electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis. In this present review, we discussed about the recent developments in the PEM water electrolysis including high performance low cost HER and OER electrocatalysts and their challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts and PEM cell components also addressed. This review will contribute further research improvements and a road map in order to support in developing the PEM water electrolyser as a commercially feasible hydrogen production purpose.},

  abstract = {The main vessel plays an important role in containing the entire primary sodium for pool-type sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs). The Reactor Vessel Cooling System (RVCS) has great effect on cooling the main vessel. However, little attention has been given to the study on transient characteristics of RVCS in the previous SFR research. Thus, a home-made one-dimensional (1-D) code named Reactor Vessel Cooling system Analysis Code for Sodium-cooled fast reactor (VECAS) is proposed to evaluate the thermal-hydraulic characteristics for SFR. The detailed models of the developed VECAS are presented in this paper. Moreover, the developed models have been validated against an experimental study. Numerical data of the main vessel cooling circuit are compared with the measurements of the Demonstration Fast Breeder Reactor (DFBR). The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the validated VECAS is coupled with the Transient Thermal-Hydraulic Analysis Code for Sodium-cooled fast reactors (THACS). The transient characteristics of RVCS in China Experimental sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (CEFR) are simulated by the coupled code. Steady analysis shows that the main vessel is cooled effectively. The peak temperature appears at the top of the main vessel lower than the permissible upper temperature limit. During the transient analysis, VECAS has predicted a reverse flow in RVCS, which contributes to the core cooling. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the main parameter has also been performed. Therefore, it can be concluded that coupled VECAS has the ability to evaluate the thermal-hydraulic characteristics as well as the decay heat removal capacity of RVCS. The coupled code could provide references and technical supports for the design and optimization of the pool-type sodiumcooled fast reactor.},

The higher the electrolyte concentration, the higher the concentration of dissolved hydrogen as H2 molecule. The concentration of dissolved hydrogen was high in the high electrolyte solutions only when current density was high. In an effort to clarify this finding, the electrolytic generated hydrogen bubble was visualized using a high speed camera. Numerous bubbles were formed under high current density, therefore, the degree of bubble coalescence increased. The bubble coalescence, however, was inhibited by addition of electrolytes. In the electrolyte solution, the hydrogen bubbles maintained the released bubble size. The high concentration of dissolved hydrogen was attributable to the bubble coalescence inhibited by the electrolyte.},

  abstract = {The next generation of nuclear energy systems, also known as Generation IV reactors, are being developed to meet the highest targets of safety and reliability, sustainability, economics, proliferation resistance, and physical protection, with improved performances compared with the currently licensed plants or those presently being built. Among the proposed technologies, lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) have been identified by nuclear industries in both Western and developing countries as being among the optimal Generation IV candidates. Since 2000, ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development is supporting the core design, safety assessment, and technological development of innovative nuclear systems cooled by heavy liquid metals (HLM) and, most recently, fully oriented on LFRs. ENEA is developing world-recognized skills in fast spectrum core design and is one of the largest European fleets of experimental facilities aiming at investigating HLM thermal-hydraulics, coolant chemistry control, corrosion behavior for structural materials, and material properties in the HLM environment, as well as at developing corrosion-protective coatings, components, instrumentation, and innovative systems, supported by experiments and numerical tools. Efforts are also dedicated to develop and validate numerical tools for specific application to HLM systems, ranging from neutronics codes, system and core thermal-hydraulic codes, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and fuel pin performance codes, including their coupling. The present work aims at highlighting the capabilities and competencies developed by ENEA so far in the framework of liquid metal technologies for Generation IV LFRs. In particular, an overview on the ongoing R\&D experimental program will be depicted considering the current fleet of facilities, namely: CIRCE, NACIE-UP, LIFUS5, LECOR, BID-1, HELENA, RACHEL, and Mechanical Labs. An overview on the numerical activities performed so far and those presently ongoing is also reported. Finally, an overview of the ENEA contribution to the ALFRED Project in the frame of the FALCON international consortium is reported, mainly addressing the ongoing activity in terms of core design, technology development, and auxiliary systems design.},

  abstract = {Sodium cooled fast reactors have been developed in France for nearly 50 years. The so-called Astrid technology demonstrator is currently designed in the frame of Generation IV deployment. Gas entrainment in the primary sodium circuit is a key issue as it can lead to safety problems in case of accumulation and transport of large quantity of gas through the core. The paper first introduces the main problems caused by the presence of gas in the primary sodium circuit, the various sources of gas and the main issues on gas transport. As sodium--argon free surface is potentially an important source of gas entrainment in the primary circuit, we present the main results obtained in past experimental studies on vortex type gas entrainment at free surface. Water tests were performed in a simple flow condition to study the physical process of vortex occurrence and gas entrainment. Other water tests were performed in representative hot pool models at different scales to analyze similarity criteria. Moreover, design improvements and local devices were tested to avoid gas entrainment at the free surface. Nowadays, numerical tools are progressively used to estimate the risk of gas entrainment at the free surface. We present the methodology in progress to define local criteria on vortex occurrence and gas entrainment, and to apply these criteria to global calculations of the whole pool. A Front-Tracking method coupled to a Large Eddy Simulation approach is implemented in TRIO\_U code to compute free surface instabilities and vortex occurrence. Experimental data from the literature are used to validate the numerical approach and a new test facility called BANGA is in progress at CEA to complete the validation.},

Thermal hydraulic challenges have progressively increased with the power and the size of the reactors. After Superphenix stop in 1997, the thermal hydraulic activity on sodium cooled fast reactors was drastically reduced for about 10 years. Nowadays, the so-called Astrid prototype developed in France in the frame of Generation IV deployment requires thermal hydraulic inputs to support the design and safety studies. This paper aims at summarizing the main thermal hydraulic challenges in sodium cooled fast reactors, on the basis of the past experience. Numerical and experimental tools used in the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) are briefly presented. The improvement on numerical simulation is emphasized with some examples of recent computations. Of course, this review is not a comprehensive one as it is mainly based on the author experience. The items covered in this paper are the subassembly, the core, the upper plenum, the lower plenum, the decay heat removal, the gas entrainment and the piping. Heat exchanger thermal hydraulics is also briefly mentioned. Several experimental and computed results are presented as simple illustrations without quantitative information on the data.},

A notable example are the so-called full-field techniques such as x-ray and neutron imaging, which allow the non destructive characterisation of the 4D (3D+time) response of geomaterials undergoing hydro--chemo--thermo-mechanical loading. While x-ray tomography has over the last decade become a pillar in the domain, neutron imaging remains a relatively less known tool. The unique properties of a neutron beam, such as high sensitivity to hydrogen (e.g., water, hydrocarbons), high penetration into metals (allowing the imposition of extreme boundary conditions), and isotope sensitivity (e.g., D2O/H2O), make neutron imaging an extremely interesting tool for experimental geomechanics.},

  abstract = {A two-phase flow model for sodium-argon mixture flow through the reactor vessel head penetrations under the energetic core disruptive accident in a sodium fast reactor (SFR) is presented. The model evaluates the total sodium mass in sodium-argon mixture released to the reactor containment building (RCB) through penetrations. The driving pressure at the penetration entrance is given as input. The two-phase frictional and local pressure drops, inertial and piezo-metric heads are accounted for in the model. Depending on the argon volume fraction, either a homogenous or separated flow approach is adopted to evaluate the mixture flow. Reactor-scale analysis show that the presence of argon in vessel head penetrations can significantly mitigate the total sodium release mass during the slug impact phase. Also, the two-phase frictional pressure drop plays a mitigating role and needs to be included in the model formulation to avoid overestimation of the sodium release mass. Fluid-structure interaction effects such as vessel head bending and hold-down bolt elongation have negligible influence on sodium release mass as long as the deformations are within the elastic limit. The model is conceived to be part of an integrated code system to evaluate the sodium fire and the maximum RCB pressure under severe accident conditions in a pool-type SFR.},

Some comparative calculations have been performed also using either JEFF-3.1, ENDF/B-VII.0 or JENDL-3.3 nuclear data for 23Na, as these three 23Na evaluations show marked differences. The Na void experiments have been selected to cover spectral conditions ranging from the relatively hard flux in the outer zone of a small fast reactor to the relatively soft flux in the inner zone of a large fast reactor. For in-fuel Na void patterns, there is a good agreement between ERANOS and TRIPOLI computations, while the deterministic calculations significantly underestimate the leakage component for Na void patterns in fertile regions. The agreement between ERANOS-2.1+JEFF-3.1 predictions and experimental values is excellent for in-fuel Na void patterns in MASURCA experiments, but a significant underestimation of the leakage component occurs for in-fuel Na void patterns in ZPPR. For fertile Na void patterns, there is a clear underestimation of the leakage component, quantitatively different for MASURCA and ZPPR experiments. Variations in 23Na cross-section data also result in significant differences: ENDF/B-VII.0 and JENDL-3.3 nuclear data for 23Na increase noticeably the predicted Na void worth values with respect to JEFF-3.1 data. The three 23Na evaluations differ at high energy ({$>$}500keV, and especially {$>$}2MeV), and this stresses the need for accurate additional measurements in this energy range.},

Our phase plot in the Galilei--E{\"o}tv{\"o}s plane shows five distinct regimes with sharply defined boundaries. Two symmetry-loss regimes are found: one with minor asymmetry restricted to a flapping skirt; and another with marked shape evolution. A perfect correlation between large shape asymmetry and path instability is established. In regimes corresponding to peripheral breakup and toroid formation, the dynamics is unsteady. A new kind of breakup, into a bulb-shaped bubble and a few satellite drops is found at low Morton numbers. The findings are of fundamental and practical relevance. It is hoped that experimenters will be motivated to check our predictions.},

Further, the project aims to support the development and validation of the computational tools for the situations to be considered at each defense-in-depth level in order to support the safety assessments using data produced in the project as well as selected legacy data. Within this activity, the focus is on the assessment and when needed further development of computer codes for the analysis of the sodium thermal-hydraulics phenomena in sodium cooled fast reactor (SFR) subassemblies under operational and accidental conditions including sodium boiling and transitional convection from forced to natural/mixed convection. In support of this activity, a review is performed for the sodium boiling models used in the codes participating in benchmark activities within the project. The objective of this paper is to summarize the result of the review, which encompasses both the phenomenological and mathematical models implemented in the codes. In particular, the review addresses the physical bases of sodium boiling models, the analytical models in connection with the numerical implementations in the codes, and the geometry representations ranging from a one-dimensional single channel and finite volume to full three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and porous media representations. Finally, the needs for further developments are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the framework of the ASTRID project at CEA, core design studies are performed at CEA with the AREVA and EDF support. At the stage of the project, pre-conceptual design studies are conducted in accordance with GEN IV reactors criteria, in particularly for safety improvements. An improved safety for a sodium cooled reactor requires revisiting many aspects of the design and is a rather lengthy process in current design approach. Two types of cores are under evaluation, one classical derivated from the SFR V2B and one more challenging called CFV (low void effect core) with a large gain on the sodium void effect. The SFR V2b core have the following specifications : a very low burn-up reactivity swing (due to a small cycle reactivity loss) and a reduced sodium void effect with regard to past designs such as the EFR (around 2\$ minus). Its performances are an average burn-up of 100 GWd/t, and an internal conversion ratio equal to one given a very good behavior of this core during a control rod withdrawal transient). The CFV with its specific design offers a negative sodium void worth while maintaining core performances. In accordance of ASTRID needs for demonstration those cores are 1500 MWth power (600 MWe). This paper will focus on the CFV pre-conceptual design of the core and S/A, and the performances in terms of safety will be evaluated on different transient scenario like ULOF, in order to assess its intrinsic behavior compared to a more classical design like V2B core. The gap in term of margin to a severe accident due to a loss of flow initiator underlines the potential capability of this type of core to enhance prevention of severe accident in accordance to safety demonstration.},

  abstract = {Growing human activity has led to a critical rise in global energy consumption; since the current main sources of energy production are still fossil fuels, this is an industry linked to the generation of harmful byproducts that contribute to environmental deterioration and climate change. One pivotal element with the potential to take over fossil fuels as a global energy vector is renewable hydrogen; but, for this to happen, reliable solutions must be developed for its carbon-free production. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive review on several hydrogen production technologies, mainly focusing on water splitting by green-electrolysis, integrated on hydrogen's value chain. The review further deepened into three leading electrolysis methods, depending on the type of electrolyzer used---alkaline, proton-exchange membrane, and solid oxide---assessing their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Based on the conclusions of this study, further developments in applications like the efficient production of renewable hydrogen will require the consideration of other types of electrolysis (like microbial cells), other sets of materials such as in anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis, and even the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks to help design, plan, and control the operation of these new types of systems.},

The theory is based on the assumptions of irrotational motion in the liquid round the bubble, constant pressure within the bubble, and small displacements from the cylindrical form. This theory predicts that the bubble should rise with the acceleration of gravity, over a distance of at least the initial bubble radius, and that a tongue of liquid should be projected up from the base of the bubble into its interior. These predictions are confirmed by experiments which also show how the vorticity necessary for steady motion in the spherical-cap form is generated by the detachment of two small bubbles from the back of the main bubble.},

  abstract = {The rise velocities of in-chain bubbles continually released from a single orifice in still water with and without crossflow are investigated in a series of laboratory experiments for wobbling ellipsoidal bubbles with moderate Reynolds number. For the limiting case in still water, that is, crossflow velocity = 0, the theoretical turbulent wake model correctly predicts the in-chain bubble rise velocity. In this case, the bubble rise velocities VB are enhanced compared to the terminal velocities of the isolated bubbles V0 due to wake drafting and are scaled with flow rate Q and bubble diameter D. Here, we also derive an updated wake model with consideration of the superposition of multiple upstream bubble wakes, which removes the nonlinear behavior of the non-distant (i.e., local) wake model. For the cases with crossflow, the enhancement of the in-chain bubble rise velocity can be significantly reduced, and imaging of the experiments shows very organized paring and grouping trajectories of rising bubbles not observed in still water under different crossflow velocities. The in-chain bubble rise velocities in crossflow are described by two models. First, an empirical model is used to correct the still-water equation for the crossflow effect. In addition, a semi-theoretical model considering the turbulent wake flow and the crossflow influence is derived and used to develop a theoretical normalization of bubble rise velocity, crossflow velocity, and the released bubble flow rate. The theoretical model suggests there are two different regimes of bubble-bubble interaction, with strong interaction occurring for the non-dimensional crossflow velocity Uc+={$\pi$}Uc3D3V0/(18g{$\beta$}Q2) less than 0.06 and weaker interaction occurring for Uc+ greater than 0.06, where Uc is the crossflow velocity, g is the acceleration of gravity, and {$\beta$} is the mixing length coefficient.},

The interaction between the dry ionomer volume fraction in CCL and reactant relative humidity (RH), as well as a CCL with through-plane (TP) and in-plane (IP) nonuniform ionomer-gradient distributions, is numerically investigated by using a three-dimensional multiphase fuel cell model. Results show that cell performance is highly sensitive to the variations in dry ionomer volume fraction in CCL under high current densities with lower RHs, and is less sensitive under low current densities with higher RHs. A higher dry ionomer volume fraction in CCL benefits proton conductivity, but causes a lower porosity and higher mass diffusion resistance under the same content of Pt/C for CCL. Overall, the dry ionomer volume fraction of 0.25 with a moderate RH of 60\% for a conventional CCL shows the best cell performance. Therefore, the results of our model support the finds of previous studies showing that an optimal ionomer volume fraction is 0.25 by volume and 0.33 by mass. This study further ascertains that a TP gradient preferable with dry ionomer volume fraction concentrated near the polymer membrane (PM)-CCL interface contributes to an improvement in cell performance. Finally, the underlying mechanism is revealed through the observation of the influence of TP and IP ionomer-gradient distributions under an RH of 60\% on the mass diffusion, the proton conductivity and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).},

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is hailed as the most desired technology for high purity hydrogen production and self-consistent with volatility of renewable energies, has ignited much attention in the past decades based on the high current density, greater energy efficiency, small mass-volume characteristic, easy handling and maintenance. To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced electrocatalysts to improve electrolytic efficiency and reduce the cost of PEM electrolyser. In this review, we firstly compare the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and PEM water electrolysis and highlight the advantages of PEM water electrolysis. Furthermore, we summarize the recent progress in PEM water electrolysis including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in the acidic electrolyte. We also introduce other PEM cell components (including membrane electrode assembly, current collector, and bipolar plate). Finally, the current challenges and an outlook for the future development of PEM water electrolysis technology for application in future hydrogen production are provided.},

Because these fluid properties arise from intermolecular bonding, a positive correlation was expected. To study the relationship between viscosity and surface tension, solutions with different concentrations of agar and flour were used. Differences in viscosity were determined by differences in flow rate. The flow rates were determined from the time that the solutions took to flow through a tube. The surface tension (Newtons/meter) was determined by the pulling force exerted on a needle placed on the surface of the solution, which was weighed using grains of rice put on a scale. Surprisingly, we found that the solutions with a higher viscosity than water had either less or the same surface tension as water, and we suspect this is due to the unchanged intermolecular bonding of water molecules (hydrogen bonding) causing surface tension as viscosity increased. A possible explanation is that the viscosity of a fluid is influenced more by the friction caused by the interactions between large molecules with a lot of polar atoms, causing attraction between them.},

Geometric and dynamic parameters of bubbles play an essential role in the numerical prediction of mass and heat transfer processes. However, the critical obstacle in bubble detection is the inability of bubble segmentation and reconstruction when the overlapping issue of multiple bubbles is serious under high void fraction conditions. A new detection and tracking technique for overlapping bubbles was proposed in this paper to identify the overlapped bubbles. First, a novel convolutional neural network is used to detect bubbles. Afterward, the relationship between the detected bubbles in two frames is correlated using the Kalman Filter and neural network. The algorithm achieves 85 \% accuracy under high overlap rate conditions in a 10 mm narrow rectangular channel with around 0.1 s for an image. In addition, a comparison test was conducted to evaluate the present technique's accuracy and robustness compared with conventional methods.},

  abstract = {With the development of sodium-cooled reactor (SFR), the research on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of liquid sodium becomes increasingly important and necessary. Through decades of experimental and theoretical research under different conditions, certain achievements have been obtained. To further carry out relevant studies, a review work on this topic is of necessity. As pointed out by scholars, sodium boiling might occur during hypothetical accidents, which might cause great damage to the SFRs. For safety analysis, the boiling of liquid sodium has already become a focus in this research area. Based on an extensive review on the published literature, this paper concerns two major topics, i.e. the boiling heat transfer and two-phase flow characteristics of liquid sodium. The former topic focuses on the characteristics of sodium boiling in pools, round tubes and annuli, including the correlations for the boiling heat transfer coefficient, the incipient boiling wall superheat and critical heat flux of dryout type. Also, the correlations for the single-phase flow in bundle channels are presented here due to the fact that relevant research on the sodium boiling in rod bundles is relatively insufficient and the relevant correlations are rarely found. For the part of two-phase flow characteristics, the correlations for the two-phase pressure drop multiplier are presented and analyzed. Finally, conclusions and prospects in this research field are summarized and proposed.},

  abstract = {Pore network models have been applied widely for simulating a variety of different physical and chemical processes, including phase exchange, non-Newtonian displacement, non-Darcy flow, reactive transport and thermodynamically consistent oil layers. The realism of such modelling, i.e. the credibility of their predictions, depends to a large extent on the quality of the correspondence between the pore space of a given medium and the pore network constructed as its representation. The main experimental techniques for pore space characterisation, including direct imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry and gas adsorption, are firstly summarised. A review of the main pore network construction techniques is then presented. Particular focus is given on how such constructions are adapted to the data from experimentally characterised pore systems. Current applications of pore network models are considered, with special emphasis on the effects of adsorption, dissolution and precipitation, as well as biomass growth, on transport coefficients. Pore network models are found to be a valuable tool for understanding and predicting meso-scale phenomena, linking single pore processes, where other techniques are more accurate, and the homogenised continuum porous media, used by engineering community.},

Based on the dual-perspective imaging of virtual binocular stereo vision, the 3D behavior characteristics of bubbles in gas-liquid two-phase flow are studied in detail, which effectively increases the projection information of bubbles to acquire more accurate behavior features. In this paper, the variations of bubble equivalent diameter, volume, velocity and trajectory in the rising process are estimated, and the factors affecting bubble behavior characteristics are analyzed. It is shown that the method is real-time and valid, the equivalent diameter of the rising bubble in the stagnant water is periodically changed, and the crests and troughs in the equivalent diameter curve appear alternately. The bubble behavior characteristics as well as the spiral amplitude are affected by the orifice diameter and the gas volume flow.},

  abstract = {Understanding the Debris Bed Formation (DBF) behavior is important to the optimized integral evaluation for Core Disruptive Accident (CDA) of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR). Aimed at clarifying the characteristics of flow regimes during DBF, extensive experimental works were carried out by releasing solid particles into a water pool. According to the preliminary studies using bottom heating and nitrogen gas injection, it was found that the effect of coolant boiling should be crucial to the flow-regime transition. However, the gas flow rate considered in these studies (0--50~L/min) was not adequate wide to cover the range of vapor flow rate from the possible drastic boiling in actual CDA of SFR. Therefore, in current study, to elucidate the influence of coolant boiling on DBF flow-regime characteristics more comprehensively and provide more extensive data for supporting the predictive model development, a greater number of experiments are conducted with a much-enlarged range of gas flow rates (up to 100~L/min) under varying parametric conditions (including particle size, particle type, water depth and release pipe diameter). Through analyzing the flow-regime transition, an extended functional form for the effect of coolant boiling is successfully proposed. By incorporating this form into our base model, the model predictability can be extended for the DBF at the conditions of coolant boiling induced by accumulated debris in accordance with the verification of the regime map. Present study is believed to be valuable for further developing and verifying the models and codes for SFR safety analysis in China.},

This paper experimentally investigated the drag coefficient of a single bubble rising in deionized water with the help of a high-speed video system. First, it is found that the terminal velocity presented periodical fluctuation, indicating that the drag coefficient is not a constant value. Then the measured drag coefficient was compared with correlations available in literatures. The comparison shows that these correlations cannot give fully satisfactory results in predicting the fluctuated drag coefficient. Based on massive data analysis, a new correlation combined Reynolds number, Eotvos number and Weber number was proposed to calculate the fluctuation of drag coefficient. The drag coefficient predicted by this new model is in excellent agreement with the experimental results over the range of 550{$\leq$}Re{$\leq$}1700, and the largest relative error is less than 0.4\%.

In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of liquid sodium fall entrained argon was carried out based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) interface tracking method to describe the entrainment process in detail, and the influences of geometry size, initial liquid level height and inlet velocity on entrainment were analyzed successively. It was found that the re-submergence velocity, having a linear relation with the re-submergence angle, is the key factor of the liquid fall type gas entrainment. It can be used to judge whether the liquid fall type entrainment occurs conservatively. In addition, the parameters affecting the re-submergence velocity are specifically analyzed from the supplementary cases, according to the results of which, the empirical relation of the re-submergence velocity is obtained. Therefore, the situation of liquid fall type gas entrainment under various working conditions can be predicted numerically.},

Understanding the flow characteristics in pore scale is significant for the design of porous structure. In this study, a numerical model was established to investigate the dynamics of a bubble penetrating through porous media at the pore scale. The two-phase interface was captured using the diffuse interface method. The influence of pore shape, width, and height on the bubble deformation, velocity, and critical pressure was investigated. For the same pore size, the largest bubble centroid velocity and the highest critical pressure exist in the quadrilateral pores compared rather than in the circular or triangular pores. As the pore width decreases, both the average velocity of the bubble centroid and the critical pressure increase. However, the critical pressure is independent of the pore height. As the pore height increases, the average velocity of the bubble centroid increases. A new correlation of the critical pressure for bubble penetration has been proposed, which is a function of the shape factor, the pore width, and the bubble diameter. The findings of this work can contribute to improving the design of porous media for two-phase separation.},

  abstract = {High heat flux dissipation can be achieved in pool boiling heat transfer through regulating the bubble escape and liquid replenishment paths over the heated surfaces. In this work, a unique design of copper foam with a wettability gradient is presented to generate separate liquid--vapor pathways for pool boiling enhancement. The effect of copper foam with a wettability gradient on bubble dynamics during nucleate boiling period is evaluated using bubble visualization experiment. Results demonstrated that the liquid replenishment and bubble escape flow is determined by copper foam with different wettability gradient. Comparing with the super-hydrophilic (SHPi) copper foam and super-hydrophobic (SHPo) copper foam, the super-hydrophilic top with super-hydrophobic bottom (SHPiT-SHPoB) copper foam structure and super-hydrophobic top with super-hydrophilic bottom (SHPoT-SHPiB) copper foam structure can achieve the critical heat flux (CHF) of 113.3~W/cm2 and 108.3~W/cm2, corresponding to the maximum heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of 5.93~W/cm2{$\cdot$}K and 5.28~W/cm2{$\cdot$}K, respectively. Two bubble escape forms and liquid replenishment models are established to give detailed explanations on the pool boiling enhancement. It is evident that when bubbles escape from sides, the bubble escape path is shorter, resulting in a faster bubble escape rate and a smaller bubble departure diameter. The experimental results also reveal that liquid replenishment rate of the SHPiT-SHPoB copper foam is also the best amongst all samples, providing a trade-off between the bubble escape and liquid replenishment in diverse conditions.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of thermal-hydraulics of core under decay heat removal conditions is essential to the safety evaluation of a sodium-cooled fast reactor. The inter-wrapper flow (IWF) has an influence on the thermalhydraulics of core. However, the study of the flow and heat transfer of IWF was limited. In this paper, a 2D layered IWF model was developed, and some tests were simulated to validate the IWF model, including heat removal tests SHRT-17 and SHRT-45R conducted in the experimental fast reactor EBR-II and a natural circulation test performed during the PHENIX end-of-life experiment. In order to simulate all the components of the primary system, the IWF model is coupled with the Transient Thermal-Hydraulic Analysis Code for Sodiumcooled fast reactors (THACS). In the simulation without IWF model, the predicted peak temperature of the instrumented subassembly XX10 in EBR-II is about 150 K lower than test data, and the predicted average outlet temperature of reactor core in PHENIX is about 20 K higher than test data. While the predictions of THACS with IWF model agree well with the test data. The results show that the IWF can be accurately simulated by the IWF model, and the IWF model improves the accuracy of the simulations of the reactor core. Further, some sensitivity analyses were conducted to provide better reference for the study of sodium-cooled fast reactors.},

Typically, some simplifications are applied to reduce the difficulty of computation and render the problem more tractable. A proposed method is that treat a number of tubes as porous media that replicates the pressure loss and heat transfer characteristics of the detailed model. The heat exchanger model of the ANSYS FLUENT code is used to analyze the heat transfer phenomena inside of the IHX and the resistance coefficients of porous media have been predicted by empirical relationships which vary with height and flow directions. Two separate models, with different size of inlet and outlet area for shell-side sodium, have been developed in this paper. By comparing the results from the different simulations, the model with larger inlet area for primary and non-uniform inlet velocity distribution of secondary sodium satisfies the design requirements with respect to the permissible upper limit of temperature difference and local radial velocity.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, the transport processes in the anodic porous transport layer (A-PTL) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis are studied in detail. A spatially distributed model of the transport processes in the A-PTL is derived and implemented, which is able to predict stationary saturation profiles and to detect drying-out behaviour at the anodic catalyst layer. The influence of the material properties on the transport limitations is analysed in order to avoid a drying-out of the system. The analysis showed that a suitable PTL material should have a porosity of {$\varepsilon$}0{$>$}0.6 , a permeability of, and a contact angle of {\texttheta}{$<$}45{$\circ$}. It is also shown that a sufficiently high water saturation in the channel of is crucial for the transport behaviour. Additionally, the bulk material properties of a Ti sintered fibre PTL are determined experimentally ({$\varepsilon$}0=0.75 , k0=6.4{\texttimes}10-14m2 , {\texttheta}=30{$\circ$}).},

  abstract = {Gas-lift pump in liquid metal cooling fast reactor (LMFR) is an innovative conceptual design to enhance the natural circulation ability of reactor core. The two phase flow characteristics of gaseliquid metal make significant improvement of the natural circulation capacity and reactor safety. It is important to study bubble flow in liquid metal. In present study, the rising behaviors of a single nitrogen bubble in 5 kinds of common stagnant liquid metals (lead bismuth alloy (LBE), liquid kalium (K), sodium (Na), potassium sodium alloy (NaeK) and lithium lead alloy (LiePb)) and in flowing lead bismuth alloy have been numerically simulated using two-dimensional moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method. The whole bubble rising process in liquid was captured. The bubble shape, rising velocity and aspect ratio during rising process of single nitrogen bubble were studied. The computational results show that, in the stagnant liquid metals, the bubble rising shape can be described by the Grace's diagram, the terminal velocity is not beyond 0.3 m/s, the terminal aspect ratio is between 0.5 and 0.6. In the flowing lead bismuth alloy, as the liquid velocity increases, both the bubble aspect ratio and terminal velocity increase as well. This work is the fundamental research of two phase flow and will be important to the study of the natural circulation capability of Accelerator Driven System (ADS) by using gas-lift pump.},
