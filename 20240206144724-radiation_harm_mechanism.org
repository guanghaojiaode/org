#+title: Radiation Harm Mechanism
The radiation with engough high energy could ionise the atoms to ions. The ionization is the process that the electrons are split out from the nuclei and an atom becomes a positive nuclei and electron(s). The cells of creatures are built up with atoms. The ionization of the atoms in creatures could lead to cancer.
