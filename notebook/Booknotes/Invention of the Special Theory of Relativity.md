At first we have this equation from Newton:

We can not determine an object is moving (v = const.) or is still. 
Then, Lorenz found that, if we change the speed of an object to be a const., the transformation of his equation will be different from the former one: Still or moving means something!
He assume that it has something to do with the speed of the light.
Einstein finally convinced that.
