#+title: Doppler Coefficient

Doppler coefficient (DTC, FTC, fuel temperature coefficient) is defined as the change in reactivity per degree change in the fuel temperature. This is in reactors *always* a negative value.

\begin{equation}
\alpha_f = \frac{d\rho}{dT_f}
\end{equation}

This is one of the most significant coefficient for nuclear safety. It reflects the  reactor stabibity simutaneously. It is faster than the [[id:b5eaa5f3-0e1f-4179-b530-8a5bf7ad9856][Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC)]].

A negative DTC and MTC ensure the a stable power operation.

The change in reactivity due to the change in the fuel temperature is called the doppler defect.

\begin{equation}
d\rho = \alpha \cdot dT
\end{equation}
