#+title: Measurement Techniques
* For liquid metal
** Intrusive measurement methods
- These methods are mainly used in the early studies and they are indirect.
- These parameters can be measured:
  + Temperature
  + Pressure fluctuation
  + Noise of bubble release
  + The time between the generation and the break of the bath surface of a bubble
  + Resistivity
- These methods can only provide local information with high uncertainty, and sometimes they are intrusive. ([[id:458876ec-83c2-4b8d-a4a7-e6b487f21046][haasReviewBubbleDynamics2021]])
** Non-intrusive methods
*** [[id:3ba2a72d-65b3-4eca-9a6e-b192b9be2c46][X-ray Imaging]]
- This is non-intrusive and the image analysis is also possible, but the problem is that the X-ray cannot penetrate deep. Instead, neutrons can penetrate deeper, but there is too much noise in neutron images.
- Problem until _2021_: limited to quasi-two-dimensional experiments ([[id:458876ec-83c2-4b8d-a4a7-e6b487f21046][haasReviewBubbleDynamics2021]])
*** [[id:64f73569-3406-4f73-b256-3be42e469dc4][Neutron Imaging]]
- Neutrons can penetrate deeper, but there is too much more noise.
*** Ultrasound Doppler Velocimetry
- Can only measure the bubble velocity, and it is very difficult when measuring a higher number of bubbles.
** Challenges
- Measurement at high temperatures is difficult because many times the measurement equipment must be put close to the objects. So the [[id:c725b5ff-1d72-486d-8d14-26b419b70dd2][Galinstan (GaInSn)]] is often used to operate experiments, because it is already liquid at room temperature.
