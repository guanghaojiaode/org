#+title: Nuclear Reactors Generation III
The Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWRs) are the first kind of Generation III reactor in the world. There are also Advanced Pressured Water Reactors (APWRs) and other reactors:
 - EPR (Evolutionary Power Reactor)
 - AP1000 (Advanced Passive PWR)
And actually these two types of reactors are regarded as Nuclear Reactors Generation III+. 

It uses pump to circulate the fluid inside the reactor. This improves the cost and the thermal efficiency.
