* Fail-Safe technology
When the reactor runs outside its designed parameters, it shut itself down automatically.

Two severe hazard in human history has reminded us that every nuclear power plant should and must have this technology:
- [[id:371ec301-6b12-404c-b31e-f6d81996fee9][Accident Three Miles Island 1979]] (the hazard was prevented by the Fail-Safe technology)
- [[id:8fe4d95c-4dc7-4a1d-9d7d-1079e5dadcdc][Accident Chernobyl 1986]] (lack of Fail-Safe technology)

The nuclear hazards could be completely avoided, if the fail-safe technologies were employed. Human is unstable, and the nuclear power plant can only be licensed for having fail-safe technologies.
