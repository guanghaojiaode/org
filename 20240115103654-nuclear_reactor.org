* Process

** neutron emitter
** uranium enrichment
- enriched $U-235$:3%~5%
- $UF_6$ is used in every enrichment method
** nuclear fission
- neutron + $U_{235}$ $\rightarrow$ $U_{236}$ $\rightarrow$ $Kr_{92}$ + $Ba_{141}$ + neutrons

* nuclear_reactor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nuclear_reactor
:END:
- nuclear fussion --> thermal energy
- questions:
  - difference between fast neutrons, thermal neutrons (and cold
    neutrons)...

** Nuclear fussion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nuclear-fussion
:END:
- a large fissile atomic nucleus (uranium-235, uranium-233, or
  plutonium-239) + a neutron --> two or more lighter nuclei + kinetic
  energy + gamma radiation + free neutrons
- free neutrons + new large fissile atomic nucleus --> ...
- nuclear chain reaction

** Heat generation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: heat-generation
:END:
- kinetic energy $\rightarrow$ thermal energy
- absorbtion of gamma rays $\rightarrow$ thermal energy
- radioactive decay

** Cooling
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cooling
:END:
- nuclear reactor coolant: water, gas metall, liquid metal (Ni or Pb),
  molten salt
- disadvantages of using water as moderators
  - results in too low neutron concentration
  - relatively low boiling points
  - inadequate cooling down in shut down mode

** Reactivity control
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reactivity-control
:END:
- movement of the control rods made of neutron poisions --> absorb
  neutrons
- *In some reactors, the coolant acts like as a moderator.*
- reactivity > 1: increase exponentially; reactivity < 1: decrease
  exponentially
- control rods
  - to control the rate of fission of the nuclear fuel
  - capable of absorbing many neutrons without themselves decaying
  - common used metal: boron (B), cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), hafnium
    (Hf), indium (In)
  - number of control rods, distance inserted --> important factors

** Generation IV reactor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: generation-iv-reactor
:END:
*** Thermal reactors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: thermal-reactors
:END:
- use slow or thermal neutrons

**** Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: very-high-temperature-reactor-vhtr
:END:
**** Molten-salt reactor (MSR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: molten-salt-reactor-msr
:END:
- works at high temperature and low pressure

**** Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: supercritical-water-cooled-reactor-scwr
:END:
- high thermal efficiency
- generation of low cost electricity

*** Fast reactors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fast-reactors
:END:
- uses fission neutrons without moderation
- energy above 1 MeV
- no neutron moderator
- rich fuel required
- all fast reactors are cooled by liquid metals (coolant)
- temperature in the core higher than thermal reactors
- less heavy atoms in the waste stream
- fast neutrons have a much lower probability of causing another fission
  than thermal neutrons

**** Gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: gas-cooled-fast-reactor-gfr
:END:
- helium-cooled
- uses a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency

**** Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sodium-cooled-fast-reactor-sfr
:END:
- The reactor design uses an unmoderated core running on fast neutrons,
  designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be consumed (and in some
  cases used as fuel)
- SFR fuel expands when the reactor overheats, automatically slowing
  down the chain reaction, making it passively safe.
- risks of handling sodium $\rightarrow$ explosive with water
- work at atmospheric pressure $\rightarrow$ reduces the leakage

**** Lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lead-cooled-fast-reactor-lfr
:END:
- is able to produce hydrogen
* Quick notes

** Why U-235 is used?
- fissionable material and fissile material
- fissionable material: high energy threshold

- fissile material: no energy threshold
  - only U-235 is a fissile material and exists in nature
** Safty strategies of a pressurized water reactor
- this is the most common nuclear reactor type
- strategies:
  1. the cladding tube of the fuel
  2. the high pressure system (the primary system)
  3. the primary system located in a closed concrete bunker called a containment
